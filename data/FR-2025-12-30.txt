In Attorney General Order Number 6260–2025 
(May 8, 2025), the Attorney General exercised her

Department of Justice (‘‘DOJ’’). 
ACTION: Final rule; partial withdrawal and correction. 
SUMMARY: In December 2020, DHS and DOJ (collectively, ‘‘the Departments’’) 
issued a final rule that clarified when an 
alien who poses a public health risk is 
ineligible for asylum and withholding of 
removal and revised their credible fear 
screening regulations. After multiple 
delays, the rule is scheduled to take 
effect on December 31, 2025. However, 
since December 2020, the Departments 
have further amended their regulations, 
complicating the codification of the 
2020 rule. In this final rule, the 
Departments are withdrawing certain 
amendments from the 2020 rule while 
leaving unaltered the rule’s substantive 
public health-related provisions, which 
will become effective as scheduled. 
DATES: 
Partial Withdrawal: As of December 
29, 2025, amendatory instructions 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14 published on 
December 23, 2020, at 85 FR 84160, 
which were delayed by the rules 
published at 86 FR 6847 (Jan. 25, 2021), 
86 FR 15069 (Mar. 22, 2021), 86 FR 
73615 (Dec. 28, 2021), 87 FR 79789 
(Dec. 28, 2022), and 89 FR 105386 (Dec. 
27, 2024), are withdrawn. 
Effective Date: The corrections in this 
document are effective December 31, 
2025.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Summary 
In December 2020, the Departments 
published the final rule titled ‘‘Security 
Bars and Processing,’’ 85 FR 84160 (Dec. 
23, 2020) (‘‘Security Bars Final Rule’’), 
to clarify that the statutory ‘‘danger to 
the security of the United States’’ bars 
to eligibility for asylum and 
withholding of removal encompass 
certain emergency public health 
concerns. Additionally, the Security 
Bars Final Rule introduced procedural 
changes relating to credible fear 
processing for certain aliens. The 
Security Bars Final Rule was slated to 
become effective on January 22, 2021; 
however, the rule’s effective date was 
delayed multiple times due to a 
preliminary injunction against a related 
rule and due to conflicts with other 
rules issued while it was delayed. See

Effective Date, 86 FR 6847 (Jan. 25,

Delay of Effective Date, 89 FR 105386 
(Dec. 27, 2024) (‘‘December 2024 Delay 
IFR’’). 
This rule withdraws amendatory 
instructions of the Security Bars Final 
Rule that would conflict with 
amendments made by rules issued 
while its effective date was delayed or 
that may otherwise cause confusion. 
The rule makes no changes to the 
substantive public health-related 
provisions that the Security Bars Final 
Rule adopted. Notably, even though the 
Departments will no longer codify 
provisions of the Security Bars Final 
Rule related to fear screening, the 
Departments may still consider the 
Security Bars Final Rule’s clarifications 
of ‘‘danger to the security of the United 
States’’ bars to asylum and withholding 
of removal, in such screenings. See 
Application of Certain Mandatory Bars 
in Fear Screenings, 89 FR 103370 (Dec. 
18, 2024) (‘‘DHS Mandatory Bars Rule’’) 
(providing USCIS asylum officers 
(‘‘AOs’’) discretion to consider the 
potential applicability of specified 
mandatory bars to asylum and statutory 
withholding of removal during fear 
screening processes); see also 
Clarification Regarding Bars to 
Eligibility During Credible Fear and 
Reasonable Fear Review, 89 FR 105392

an AO’s determination that a mandatory 
bar applies in credible and reasonable 
fear reviews). 
II. Background 
A. Legal Authority 
The Attorney General
2
and the 
Secretary of Homeland Security issue 
this rule pursuant to their respective 
authorities concerning asylum and 
withholding of removal determinations. 
The Homeland Security Act of 2002 
(‘‘HSA’’), Public Law 107–296, 116 Stat. 
2135, as amended, transferred many 
functions related to the execution of 
Federal immigration law to the newly 
created DHS. The Immigration and 
Nationality Act (‘‘INA’’ or ‘‘Act’’), as 
amended, charges the Secretary ‘‘with 
the administration and enforcement of 
this chapter and all other laws relating

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61036 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 3
Additionally, under the HSA, references to the 
‘‘Attorney General’’ in the INA also encompass the 
Secretary with respect to statutory authorities 
vested in the Secretary by the HSA or subsequent 
legislation, including in relation to immigration 
proceedings before DHS. 6 U.S.C. 251, 271(b)(3), (5), 
557. 
4
If USCIS does not approve an affirmative 
application for asylum and the alien appears to be 
inadmissible under section 212(a) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1182(a), or deportable under section 237(a) 
of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1227(a), then, subject to certain 
exceptions, USCIS will place the alien into removal 
proceedings under section 240 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1229a, where the affirmative asylum application 
may be renewed for consideration by the 
Immigration Judge. 8 CFR 208.14(c)(1). 
5
When the HSA established DHS, the Citizenship 
and Immigration Services component was known as 
the ‘‘Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration 
Services.’’ 6 U.S.C. 271(a)(1). DHS later changed the 
name of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration 
Services to USCIS. Name Change From the Bureau 
of Citizenship and Immigration Services to U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services, 69 FR 60938, 
60938 (Oct. 13, 2004). 
6
USCIS has jurisdiction to adjudicate defensive 
asylum applications filed by unaccompanied alien 
children in removal proceedings. INA 208(b)(3)(C), 
8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(3)(C); see also 6 U.S.C. 279(g) 
(defining ‘‘unaccompanied alien child’’). 
to the immigration and naturalization of 
aliens,’’ INA 103(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 
1103(a)(1), and grants the Secretary the 
power to take all actions ‘‘necessary for 
carrying out’’ the Secretary’s authority 
under the provisions of the INA, INA 
103(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(3).
3
The HSA 
also transferred to DHS responsibility 
for initial adjudication of affirmative 
asylum applications, i.e., applications for asylum first made outside the 
removal context. See 6 U.S.C. 271(b)(3).4
 
Specifically, the HSA vested the 
adjudication of affirmative asylum and 
refugee applications with USCIS.
5
Id. 
USCIS AOs determine in the first 
instance whether an alien’s affirmative 
asylum application should be granted. 
See 8 CFR 208.2(a)(1). But the HSA retained DOJ’s authority 
over certain individual immigration 
adjudications including those related to 
defensive asylum applications, i.e., 
applications for asylum made in 
removal proceedings under section 240 
of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1229a (‘‘section 240 
removal proceedings’’). EOIR conducts 
these adjudications, subject to the 
direction and regulation of the Attorney 
General. See 6 U.S.C. 521; INA 103(g), 8 U.S.C. 1103(g); INA 240, 8 U.S.C. 
1229a. Thus, Immigration Judges within 
DOJ generally continue to adjudicate all 
defensive asylum applications filed by 
aliens during section 240 removal 
proceedings in addition to adjudicating 
affirmative asylum applications referred 
to section 240 removal proceedings by 
USCIS.
6
See INA 101(b)(4), 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(4) (defining ‘‘[I]mmigration 
[J]udge’’); 8 CFR 208.14(c)(1), 1208.2(b); 
Dhakal v. Sessions, 895 F.3d 532, 536– 37 (7th Cir. 2018) (describing affirmative 
and defensive asylum processes). The 
Board of Immigration Appeals (‘‘BIA’’ or 
‘‘Board’’), also within DOJ’s EOIR, in 
turn hears appeals from Immigration 
Judges’ decisions in section 240 removal 
proceedings. See 8 CFR 1003.1(b)(3). In addition, the INA provides ‘‘[t]hat 
determination and ruling by the 
Attorney General with respect to all 
questions of law shall be controlling.’’ 
INA 103(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(1). 
B. Legal Framework for Asylum and 
Withholding 
Asylum is a discretionary benefit that 
the Attorney General or the Secretary 
can grant if an alien establishes, among 
other things, that he or she has 
experienced past persecution or has a 
well-founded fear of future persecution 
on account of race, religion, nationality, 
membership in a particular social group, 
or political opinion. INA 208(b)(1), 8 
U.S.C. 1158(b)(1) (providing that the 
Attorney General and Secretary ‘‘may’’ 
grant asylum to refugees); INA 
101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(A) 
(defining ‘‘refugee’’). Aliens who are 
ineligible for a grant of asylum, or who 
are denied asylum based on the 
Attorney General’s or the Secretary’s 
discretion, nonetheless may qualify for 
other forms of protection. Specifically, 
an alien may be eligible for withholding 
of removal under section 241(b)(3) of 
the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3) (‘‘statutory 
withholding of removal’’) or 
withholding or deferral of removal 
under the regulations implementing 
U.S. obligations under Article 3 of the 
Convention Against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 
1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85, 114 (‘‘CAT’’). 
See 8 CFR 208.3(b), 208.13(c)(1), 208.16(c), 208.17(c), 1208.3(b), 
1208.13(c)(1), 1208.16(c), 1208.17. 
Withholding and deferral of removal 
bar an alien’s removal to a specific 
country where the alien would ‘‘more 
likely than not’’ face persecution or 
torture, meaning that the alien would 
face a clear probability that his or her 
life or freedom would be threatened on 
account of a protected ground or a clear 
probability of torture. 8 CFR 
208.16(b)(2), (c)(2), 1208.16(b)(2), (c)(2); 
see INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 413, 424, 430 (1984) (holding that the ‘‘clear 
probability’’ or ‘‘more likely than not’’ 
standard applies to withholding of 
deportation). Thus, if an alien 
establishes that it is more likely than not 
that the alien’s life or freedom would be 
threatened on account of a protected 
ground in a specific country, but is 
denied asylum for some other reason, 
the alien nonetheless may be entitled to 
statutory withholding of removal to that 
specific country if not also barred from 
that form of protection. INA 
241(b)(3)(A), (B), 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(A), 
(B); 8 CFR 208.16, 1208.16. Likewise, an 
alien who establishes that he or she is 
more likely than not to face torture in 
the country of removal will qualify for 
protection under the regulations 
implementing the CAT (also referred to 
as ‘‘CAT protection’’). See 8 CFR 208.16(c), 208.17(a), 1208.16(c), 
1208.17(a). 
The INA provides mandatory bars to 
applying for asylum at section 208(a)(2) 
of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158(a)(2), to 
asylum eligibility at section 208(b)(2)(A) 
of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A), and 
to eligibility for withholding of removal 
at section 241(b)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(B) (referred to 
collectively as ‘‘mandatory bars’’). 
Pursuant to the CAT regulations, the 
mandatory bars to eligibility for 
withholding of removal under section 
241(b)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1231(b)(3)(B), also apply to withholding 
of removal under those regulations. 8 
CFR 208.16(d)(2), 1208.16(d)(2). If an 
alien would be entitled to withholding 
of removal under the CAT regulations 
but for being subject to a mandatory bar, 
the alien is entitled to deferral of 
removal pursuant to 8 CFR 208.17(a), 
1208.17(a). 8 CFR 208.16(c)(4), 
1208.16(c)(4). There are no bars to 
deferral of removal under the CAT 
regulations. 
Specifically, the INA imposes the 
following statutory bars to asylum 
eligibility at section 208(b)(2)(A)(i)–(v), 
8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)–(v), and to 
eligibility for withholding of removal at 
section 241(b)(3)(B), 8 U.S.C. 
1231(b)(3)(B) for persons: (1) who 
‘‘ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise 
participated in the persecution of any 
person’’ ‘‘on account of’’ or ‘‘because of’’ 
a protected ground, INA 208(b)(2)(A)(i), 
241(b)(3)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(i), 
1231(b)(3)(B)(i); (2) who have been 
convicted of a ‘‘particularly serious 
crime,’’ INA 208(b)(2)(A)(ii), 
241(b)(3)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 
1158(b)(2)(A)(ii), 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii); (3) for 
whom ‘‘there are serious reasons to 
believe that the alien committed a 
serious nonpolitical crime outside the 
United States,’’ INA 208(b)(2)(A)(iii), 
241(b)(3)(B)(iii), 8 U.S.C. 
1158(b)(2)(A)(iii), 1231(b)(3)(B)(iii); (4) 
for whom ‘‘there are reasonable grounds 
to believe that the alien is a danger to 
the security of the United States,’’ INA 
208(b)(2)(A)(iv), 241(b)(3)(B)(iv), 8 
U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(iv), 
1231(b)(3)(B)(iv); and (5) who are 
described in certain terrorism-related 
provisions, INA 208(b)(2)(A)(v),

The ‘‘significant possibility of eligibility for 
asylum’’ standard to be applied in expedited 
removal proceedings is lower than the ‘‘reasonable 
possibility of persecution or torture’’ standard 
because the expedited removal statute speaks in 
terms of the possibility of eligibility for asylum, 
which requires the alien to show a well-founded 
fear of persecution. INA 235(b)(1)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 
1225(b)(1)(B)(v) (requiring ‘‘a significant possibility 
. . . that the alien could establish eligibility for 
asylum under section 208’’); INA 101(a)(42)(A), 8 
U.S.C. 1101(a)(42)(A) (requiring aliens to establish 
a ‘‘well-founded fear of persecution on account of’’ 
a protected ground to be a ‘‘refugee’’); INA 
208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(1)(A) (allowing for a 
grant of asylum where an alien establishes that he 
or she is a ‘‘refugee’’). The Supreme Court has 
equated the ‘‘well-founded fear’’ standard with a 
‘‘reasonable possibility.’’ See INS v. Cardoza- Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 440 (1987) (quoting Stevic, 467 U.S. at 424–25). Put another way, the statutory 
credible fear standard requires the officer to 
determine whether the alien has a significant 
possibility of establishing a reasonable possibility of 
persecution. When the officer applies only a 
‘‘reasonable possibility of persecution or torture’’ 
standard, the inquiry is into the possibility of the 
harm taking place, not the possibility of meeting the 
ultimate standard. 
241(b)(3)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(v), 
1231(b)(3)(B). 
A sixth statutory bar to eligibility for 
asylum, which does not bar eligibility 
for withholding of removal, applies to 
any alien who ‘‘was firmly resettled in 
another country prior to arriving in the 
United States.’’ INA 208(b)(2)(A)(vi), 8 
U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi). Additionally, 
there are statutory bars to withholding 
of removal eligibility for admitted aliens 
who are deportable under section 
237(a)(4)(D) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1227(a)(4)(D), for involvement in 
genocide, torture, extrajudicial killing, 
or Nazi persecution as defined in 
section 212(a)(3)(E)(i)–(iii) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(E)(i)–(iii). See INA 241(b)(3)(B), 8 U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(B); 8 
CFR 1208.16(d)(2). 
C. Expedited Removal and Screenings in 
the Credible Fear Process 
In the Illegal Immigration Reform and 
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 
(‘‘IIRIRA’’), Public Law 104–208, div. C, 
110 Stat. 3009, 3009–546, Congress 
established the expedited removal 
process. This process applies to certain 
aliens who are present in the United 
States without having been admitted or 
having been paroled into the United 
States or who are arriving in the United 
States (and, in the discretion of the 
Secretary, certain other designated 
classes of aliens), provided the aliens 
are also either (1) inadmissible under 
section 212(a)(6)(C) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1182(a)(6)(C), which renders 
inadmissible aliens who make certain 
material misrepresentations; or (2) 
inadmissible under section 212(a)(7) of 
the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(7), which 
renders inadmissible aliens who lack 
documents required for admission. INA 
235(b)(1)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). 
DHS may remove an alien subject to 
expedited removal, ‘‘without further 
hearing or review unless the [alien] 
indicates either an intention to apply for 
asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.’’ 
Id. 
Congress created a screening process, 
known as ‘‘credible fear’’ screening, to 
identify potentially valid claims for 
asylum by aliens in expedited removal 
proceedings. The Departments have 
used the same screening process to 
identify potentially valid claims for 
statutory withholding of removal and 
CAT protection. If an alien indicates a 
fear of persecution or torture, a fear of 
return to his or her country (which may 
involve possible persecution or torture, 
even if not necessarily articulated as 
such by the alien), or an intention to 
apply for asylum during the course of 
the expedited removal process, DHS 
refers the alien to a USCIS AO to 
determine whether the alien has a 
credible fear of persecution or torture in 
the country of citizenship or removal. 
INA 235(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B), 8 U.S.C. 
1225(b)(1)(A)(ii), (B); see also 8 CFR 
235.3(b)(4). An alien has a ‘‘credible fear 
of persecution’’ if ‘‘there is a significant 
possibility, taking into account the 
credibility of the statements made by 
the alien in support of the alien’s claim 
and such other facts as are known to the 
officer, that the alien could establish 
eligibility for asylum.’’ INA 
235(b)(1)(B)(v), 8 U.S.C. 
1225(b)(1)(B)(v). If the AO determines 
that the alien does not have a credible 
fear of persecution or torture, the alien 
may request that an Immigration Judge 
review that determination. See INA 235(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III), 8 U.S.C. 
1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(III); 8 CFR 208.30(g), 
208.33(b)(2)(v), 1208.30(g). 
D. Security Bars Rule and Subsequent 
Delays 
On July 9, 2020, the Departments 
published a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (‘‘NPRM’’) titled ‘‘Security 
Bars and Processing,’’ 85 FR 41201 
(‘‘Security Bars NPRM’’). On December 
23, 2020, the Departments published the 
Security Bars Final Rule, responding to 
comments received in response to the 
NPRM. 85 FR 84160. The Security Bars 
Final Rule amended the Departments’ 
asylum and withholding of removal 
regulations to provide that certain 
emergency public health concerns 
generated by a communicable disease 
constitute circumstances for which 
there are ‘‘reasonable grounds for 
regarding’’ or ‘‘reasonable grounds to 
believe that an alien is a danger to the 
security of the United States,’’ making 
the alien ineligible to be granted asylum 
and ineligible for withholding of 
removal, both under the INA and under 
the CAT regulations. See 85 FR 84193– 94, 84196–97. The Security Bars Final 
Rule also amended the Departments’ 
credible fear regulations, including by 
modifying changes made to the 
regulatory framework by a rule that the 
Departments published during the 
period between the Security Bars NPRM 
and the Security Bars Final Rule. See 
Procedures for Asylum and Withholding 
of Removal; Credible Fear and 
Reasonable Fear Review, 85 FR 80274 
(Dec. 11, 2020) (‘‘Global Asylum Final 
Rule’’). 
Relevant to this rule, the Global 
Asylum Final Rule and amendatory 
instructions 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 of the 
Security Bars Final Rule amended the 
regulations setting forth the process for 
aliens in expedited removal who 
indicate a fear of removal or an intent 
to apply for asylum in multiple ways. 
First, the rules require that, during 
credible fear screenings and reviews, 
AOs and Immigration Judges consider 
the applicability of any bars to being 
able to apply for asylum or to eligibility 
for asylum set forth at section 
208(a)(2)(B)–(C) and (b)(2) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1158(a)(2)(B)–(C) and (b)(2), 
including any bars established by 
regulation under section 208(b)(2)(C) of 
the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(C), and any 
bars to withholding of removal at 
section 241(b)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1231(b)(3)(B). See 85 FR 80390–91, 80393, 80399 (Global Asylum Final Rule 
amending §§ 208.30(e)(1)(iii), (2)(iii), 
(5)(i), 1003.42(d)(1), 1208.30(g)(1)); 85 
FR 84194–96 (Security Bars Final Rule 
amending §§ 208.30(e)(5)(i)(A), 
(e)(5)(iv), 1003.42(d)(1)). 
Second, if the AO or Immigration 
Judge determined that an alien does not 
have a significant possibility of 
eligibility for asylum due to the 
operation of a regulatory bar or any 
statutory bar to asylum eligibility, the 
AO or Immigration Judge would screen 
the alien for potential statutory 
withholding of removal and CAT 
protection eligibility under the 
‘‘reasonable possibility of persecution or 
torture’’ standard—a standard higher 
than the ‘‘significant possibility of 
demonstrating eligibility for asylum’’ 
standard that otherwise applied.

possibility of persecution but for being 
subject to one or both of the bars to 
asylum and withholding for those who 
pose a ‘‘danger to the security of the 
United States’’ at section 
208(b)(2)(A)(iv) or 241(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the 
INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(iv) or 
1231(b)(3)(B)(iv), the AO or Immigration 
Judge would screen the alien to 
determine whether he or she would be 
more likely than not to be tortured in 
the country of removal. 85 FR 84194–95, 
84197–8 (Security Bars Final Rule 
amending §§ 208.30(e)(5)(iii)(B), (C), 
(iv)(A)(1), (2), (f), 1208.30(g)(1)(ii)). If 
the alien met that burden, DHS would 
either place the alien in asylum-and- 
withholding-only (‘‘AWO’’) proceedings 
instead of section 240 removal 
proceedings or remove the alien to a 
third country. 85 FR 84194–95 (Security 
Bars Final Rule amending 
§ 208.30(e)(5)(iii)(B), (iv)(A)(2)). Unlike 
section 240 removal proceedings, during 
which aliens may apply for any form of 
relief or protection for which they may 
be eligible, aliens in AWO proceedings 
may apply only for asylum, statutory 
withholding of removal, and CAT 
protection. See 8 CFR 1208.2(c)(1). Fourth, aliens determined to have a 
credible fear of persecution, or a 
reasonable possibility of persecution or 
torture, would be referred for AWO 
proceedings. 85 FR 80392 (Global 
Asylum Final Rule amending 
§ 208.30(f)); 85 FR 84194–95, 84197–98 
(Security Bars Final Rule amending 
§§ 208.30(e)(5)(i)(B), (f)(1), 
1208.30(g)(1)(ii), (2)(iv)(B)). 
Fifth, if an alien refused to indicate 
whether he or she wants Immigration 
Judge review of a negative 
determination, DHS would consider 
such a refusal as declining review. 85 
FR 80392, 80399 (Global Asylum Final 
Rule amending §§ 208.30(g)(1) and

amending §§ 208.30(g)(1) and 
1208.30(g)(2)(i)). 
The Global Asylum Final Rule and 
Security Bars Final Rule also amended 
provisions relating to the processes for 
applying two since-rescinded regulatory 
bars to asylum eligibility, see 85 FR 80390–91 (Global Asylum Final Rule 
amending §§ 208.30(e)(5)(ii)–(iii), 
1003.42(d)(2)–(3), 1208.30(g)(1)(i)–(ii)); 
85 FR 84194–95, 84197–98 (Security 
Bars Final Rule amending 
§ 208.30(e)(5)(iii), 1208.30(g)(1)(ii)),
8
 
and updated language in various 
provisions to take account of the 
heightened ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ and 
‘‘more likely than not’’ standards, see 85 FR 80389–94, 80399–400 (Global 
Asylum Final Rule amending various 
provisions in §§ 208.30, 1003.42, and 
1208.30); 85 FR 84194––98 (Security 
Bars Final Rule amending 
§§ 208.30(e)(4), (g)(1), 235.6(a)(2)(i), 
1208.30(e), (g)(2)(iv)(A)–(B), 
1235.6(a)(2)(i)). 
Although the Security Bars Final Rule 
was originally scheduled to take effect 
on January 22, 2021, intervening events 
and circumstances required the 
Departments to delay its effective date, 
most recently until December 31, 2025.
9
 
First, prior to the January 22, 2021, 
effective date of the Security Bars Final 
Rule, a district court preliminarily 
enjoined the Departments ‘‘from 
implementing, enforcing, or applying 
the [Global Asylum Final Rule] or any 
related policies or procedures.’’ Pangea 
Legal Servs. v. DHS, 512 F. Supp. 3d 966, 977 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (‘‘Pangea II’’). 
The Security Bars Final Rule explicitly 
relied on changes made by the Global 
Asylum Final Rule, and the regulatory 
text of the Security Bars Final Rule 
repeated broader changes made by the 
Global Asylum Final Rule, such as 
requiring the application of bars to 
asylum eligibility and withholding of 
removal during credible fear screenings. 
See, e.g., 85 FR 84187–88. Accordingly, 
as a result of the Pangea II preliminary 
injunction, the Departments determined 
that delay of the Security Bars Final 
Rule’s effective date was justified. See 
January 2021 Delay Final Rule, 86 FR 
6847; March 2021 Delay IFR, 86 FR 
15070–71; December 2021 Delay IFR, 86 
FR 73616–17; December 2022 Delay IFR, 
87 FR 79790–91; December 2024 Delay 
IFR, 89 FR 105387. 
In the December 2022 Delay IFR, the 
Departments explained that they were 
delaying the Security Bars Final Rule’s 
effective date because its 
implementation remained infeasible due 
to the Pangea II preliminary injunction 
against the Global Asylum Final Rule 
and related policies and procedures. See 
87 FR 79790–91. Further, the 
Departments determined that, as a result 
of a subsequent, intervening 
rulemaking, Procedures for Credible 
Fear Screening and Consideration of 
Asylum, Withholding of Removal, and 
CAT Protection Claims by Asylum 
Officers, 87 FR 18078 (Mar. 29, 2022) 
(‘‘Asylum Processing IFR’’), 
implementation of the Security Bars 
Final Rule would result in conflicting 
and confusing regulatory text. 87 FR 
79791–92. The Departments thus 
explained that delaying the effective 
date until December 31, 2024, would 
permit the Departments ‘‘sufficient time 
to complete notice-and-comment 
rulemaking to modify or rescind the 
Security Bars final rule, even in the 
event that circumstances require 
shifting departmental priorities and 
resources.’’ 87 FR 79792. 
However, superseding regulatory 
priorities prevented completion of the 
anticipated rulemaking prior to 
December 31, 2024. After considering 
public comments on the December 2022 
Delay IFR related to the Security Bars 
Final Rule’s effective date, the 
Departments determined that it was 
appropriate to delay the rule’s effective 
date until December 31, 2025, ‘‘in light 
of the Departments’ limited resources 
and intervening regulatory priorities.’’ 
December 2024 Delay IFR, 89 FR 
105388. The Departments also 
explained that allowing the Security 
Bars Final Rule to become effective 
would ‘‘conflict with regulatory changes 
implemented by the intervening 
rulemakings, resulting in conflicting 
and confusing changes to the 
Departments’ regulations.’’ See 89 FR 105388. The Departments also noted 
that, since the publication of the 
Security Bars Final Rule, the 
Departments had issued multiple 
additional rules altering the credible 
fear screening process and asylum 
eligibility more generally. See, e.g., 
Asylum Processing IFR, 87 FR 18078; 
Circumvention of Lawful Pathways, 88 
FR 31314 (May 16, 2023) (‘‘Lawful 
Pathways Final Rule’’); DHS Mandatory 
Bars Rule, 89 FR 103370; Securing the 
Border, 89 FR 81156 (Oct. 7, 2024). The 
Departments determined that the 
intervening rules and their impacts on 
screening processes required further 
evaluation of ‘‘their potential interplay 
with the Security Bars final rule.’’ See 
89 FR 105388. 
Beyond these important 
considerations, the Departments also 
concluded that ‘‘there would be no 
direct, immediate impact on eligibility 
for asylum or other protection if the 
Security Bars final rule were to go into 
effect on December 31, 2024, because 
there [was] no existing public health 
situation that would trigger the bars 
outlined in the rule.’’ 89 FR 105389. The 
Departments determined that the lack of 
any immediate impact further supported 
delaying the effective date. Accordingly, 
based on the foregoing considerations, 
the Departments delayed the effective 
date of the Security Bars Final Rule to 
December 31, 2025. 89 FR 105389. The 
Departments also continued to welcome

comments about the effective date of the 
Security Bars Final Rule but did not 
seek comments on whether the 
Departments should modify or rescind 
the rule or comments otherwise 
addressing the substance of the rule. 89 
FR 105389. 
E. Subsequent Rules 
Since the publication of the Security 
Bars Final Rule, the Departments have 
issued four rules amending their 
credible fear provisions that are relevant 
here: (1) the Asylum Processing IFR; (2) 
the Lawful Pathways Final Rule; (3) the 
DHS Mandatory Bars Rule; and (4) the 
EOIR Bars IFR. Those rules’ 
amendments overwrote or rescinded 
provisions that the Security Bars Final 
Rule would amend upon becoming 
effective. Accordingly, some of the 
Security Bars Final Rule’s amendments, 
if allowed to go into effect, would create 
conflicting text and inconsistent and 
confusing terminology that would 
complicate implementing the 
regulations. Further, amendments that 
the Departments adopted after the 
Security Bars Final Rule would be 
overwritten without justification for the 
reversion and without observing the 
procedures typically required by the 
Administrative Procedure Act (‘‘APA’’). 
Overall, implementation of the Security 
Bars Final Rule without any change 
would put the Departments’ ability to 
use the expedited removal system at 
risk. These issues are discussed in 
greater detail below. 
1. Asylum Processing IFR 
On March 29, 2022, the Departments 
issued the Asylum Processing IFR. As 
relevant here, the Asylum Processing 
IFR amended 8 CFR 208.30, 1003.42, 
and 1208.30 to generally return to the 
regulatory framework in place prior to 
the promulgation of the Global Asylum 
Final Rule. 87 FR 18091. The specific 
amendments that were reversed by the 
Asylum Processing IFR were those that 
required the consideration of mandatory 
bars during credible fear screenings, 
provided procedures for aliens 
determined to be subject to such bars, 
required that aliens with a positive 
screening determination be placed in 
AWO proceedings, and mandated that 
an alien’s failure to indicate whether he 
or she wants Immigration Judge review 
of a negative determination be 
interpreted as a decision to decline such 
review. 87 FR 18218–23 (amending 
portions of §§ 208.30, 235.6, 1003.42, 
1208.30, and 1235.6). In doing so, the 
Asylum Processing IFR amended 8 CFR 
208.30 to remove paragraphs (e)(5)(i)(A) 
and (B) and (f)(1)—paragraphs the 
Security Bars Final Rule would amend 
upon becoming effective—as discussed 
in Section III.A of this preamble. 
2. Lawful Pathways Final Rule 
On May 16, 2023, the Departments 
published the Lawful Pathways Final 
Rule, 88 FR 31314, which, as relevant 
here, rescinded an earlier, enjoined final 
rule regarding transit through a third 
country, Asylum Eligibility and 
Procedural Modifications, 85 FR 82260 
(Dec. 17, 2020) (‘‘TCT Bar Final Rule’’). 
Notably, to rescind the TCT Bar Final 
Rule, the Departments removed various 
regulatory provisions including, as 
relevant here, 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5)(iii) 
and 1208.30(g)(1). See 88 FR 31319. If the Departments did not withdraw 
amendatory instructions 4 and 12 of the 
Security Bars Final Rule, the Security 
Bars Final Rule would add these 
specific provisions back into the 
regulations. See 85 FR 84194–5, 84197– 98. The addition of these provisions 
would thus establish procedures for 
adjudicators to follow when considering 
the application of the TCT bar, which 
no longer exists. See 88 FR 31449, 31451 (removing and reserving 
paragraph (c)(4) of §§ 208.13 and 
1208.13). To avoid codifying such 
obsolete regulatory language, the 
Departments are withdrawing 
amendatory instructions 4 and 12 of the 
Security Bars Final Rule. 
3. DHS Mandatory Bars Rule 
On December 18, 2024, DHS issued 
the DHS Mandatory Bars Rule, which, 
as relevant here, allows AOs to consider 
the potential applicability of statutory 
bars to asylum and withholding of 
removal during credible fear screenings 
except for the bar to asylum for aliens 
who were firmly resettled in another 
country.
10
See 89 FR 103370. Under the DHS Mandatory Bars Rule, AOs 
determine at their discretion whether to 
consider these statutory bars to asylum 
and withholding of removal during fear 
screenings; in contrast, the Security Bars 
Final Rule would make such 
consideration mandatory. See 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5)(ii); 85 FR 84190, 84194–95. 
If the Security Bars Final Rule were to 
go into effect in its entirety, certain 
provisions within the Code of Federal 
Regulations (‘‘CFR’’) would continue to 
make the consideration of bars 
discretionary, while others would make 
it mandatory. Specifically, current 
paragraph (ii) of 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5) 
provides that where an alien ‘‘appears to 
be subject to one or more of the 
mandatory bars’’ other than the firm 
resettlement bar, the AO ‘‘may consider 
the applicability of such bar(s).’’ But 
amendatory instruction 4 of the Security 
Bars Final Rule would add paragraph 
(iv), which would also require 
application of any mandatory bar, 
including the firm resettlement bar. See 
85 FR 84194–95. Additionally, 8 CFR 
208.30(e)(5) would set forth different 
screening standards where an alien is 
subject to a mandatory bar to asylum 
and withholding of removal that would 
vary depending on the type of 
mandatory bar—under current 
paragraph (ii), the applicable screening 
standard for torture where an alien is 
subject to a mandatory bar to asylum 
and withholding of removal is the 
‘‘significant possibility’’ of 
demonstrating eligibility for CAT 
protection standard, whereas under 
paragraph (iv), if the alien is subject to 
the security bars to asylum and 
withholding of removal, the alien would 
be screened for torture at the ‘‘more 
likely than not’’ standard. Compare 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5), with 85 FR 84194–95 (adding paragraph (iv) to 8 CFR 
208.30(e)(5)). Finally, the discretionary 
provisions at current paragraph (ii) 
would require placing an alien who 
receives a positive determination into 
section 240 removal proceedings or 
allowing USCIS to maintain jurisdiction 
for further consideration of the 
application, whereas paragraph (iv) 
would require that DHS place the alien 
into AWO proceedings or remove the 
alien to a third country, as applicable. 
These irreconcilable provisions require 
the withdrawal of amendatory 
instruction 4. 
4. EOIR Bars IFR 
Shortly after publication of DHS’s 
Mandatory Bars Rule, DOJ published the 
EOIR Bars IFR, 89 FR 105392, to clarify 
that Immigration Judges review AOs’ 
credible fear determinations de novo, 
including, where relevant, an AO’s 
application of any bars to asylum or 
withholding of removal. To effectuate 
this clarification, and as relevant here, 
EOIR amended 8 CFR 1003.42(d) to 
explicitly state that the Immigration 
Judge’s de novo credible fear 
‘‘determination shall, where relevant, 
include review of the asylum officer’s 
application of any bars to asylum and 
withholding of removal pursuant to 8 
CFR 208.30(e)(5).’’ 89 FR 105402. 
However, amendatory instruction 8 of 
the Security Bars Final Rule instructs 
the Office of the Federal Register 
(‘‘OFR’’) to revise 8 CFR 1003.42(d)(1), 
a paragraph that no longer exists. See 85 FR 84196; see also 8 CFR 1003.42. If the 
Departments do not withdraw 
amendatory instruction 8 of the Security 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:11 Dec 29, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30DER1.SGM 30DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61040 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 11
See March 2021 Delay IFR, 86 FR 15069, 15071 (requesting comment on ‘‘a potential future 
rulemaking rescinding or amending the Security 
Bars’’ Final Rule); December 2021 Delay IFR, 86 FR 
73617; December 2022 Delay IFR, 87 FR 79792–93. 
Bars Final Rule, see 85 FR 84196, the OFR would be unable to revise a non- 
existent paragraph and thus would add 
an editorial note to 8 CFR 1003.42 to 
indicate an apparent agency error, 
creating confusion and leading to 
questions surrounding the text’s validity 
and effect. Cf. Document Drafting 
Handbook 6–4 (June 2025), https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/ 
write/handbook/ddh.pdf (‘‘Document Drafting Handbook’’) (noting that OFR 
may ‘‘add an editorial note of the agency 
error’’ in the context of other sorts of 
discrepancies in regulations). Thus, 
EOIR’s regulations would lack the 
clarity needed as to whether an 
Immigration Judge is able to review any 
bars the AO may have applied pursuant 
to 8 CFR 208.30(e)(5) in making a 
negative fear determination. 
Accordingly, for clarity of the 
regulations, EOIR will maintain its later- 
enacted provision from the EOIR Bars 
IFR at 8 CFR 1003.42(d), which 
necessitates withdrawing amendatory 
instruction 8 of the Security Bars Final 
Rule. 
III. Discussion 
The Departments have considered the 
complete history of this rulemaking, the 
subsequent history of the provisions it 
was poised to amend as discussed in 
Sections II.D and E of this preamble, 
and all concerns raised by commenters 
in response to the delay rules, as 
discussed below in Sections IV and V of 
this preamble. Although the 
Departments previously suggested that 
they may initiate a new rulemaking with 
respect to the Security Bars Final 
Rule,
11
the Departments after further 
consideration decline to pursue a new 
rulemaking. Instead, the rule will take 
effect as scheduled with specific 
amendments withdrawn to avoid 
conflicting or confusing regulatory text. 
The portions of the Security Bars 
Final Rule that will remain unchanged 
and go into effect as previously 
scheduled are the substantive 
provisions that clarify that the bars to 
asylum and withholding of removal for 
those who pose a danger to the security 
of the United States cover aliens who 
may pose certain public health risks. 
These provisions will be codified at 8 
CFR 208.13(c)(10), 1208.13(c)(10) 
(clarification with respect to asylum), 
and at 8 CFR 208.16(d)(2), 1208.16(d)(2) 
(clarification with respect to statutory 
and CAT withholding of removal). 
However, the Departments now 
withdraw certain amendments in the 
Security Bars Final Rule. The 
Departments are withdrawing the 
amendatory instructions that would 
amend the Departments’ credible fear 
regulations because, as explained in 
Sections II.E and III.A of this preamble, 
codification of those provisions is 
irreconcilable with the current state of 
the regulations, which the Departments 
have amended multiple times since the 
publication of the Security Bars Final 
Rule. Additionally, as explained in 
Section III.B of this preamble, the 
Departments are withdrawing 
amendments relating to the ability to 
remove aliens to third countries to avoid 
unnecessary confusion. Thus, this rule 
withdraws the amendatory instructions 
from the Security Bars Final Rule to the 
extent that they would amend 8 CFR 
208.16(f), 208.30, 235.6, 1003.42, 
1208.16(f), 1208.30, and 1235.6, and the 
Security Bars Final Rule will no longer 
amend those provisions. The reasons for 
withdrawal of the amendatory 
instructions related to these specific 
provisions are discussed further below. 
A. Withdrawing Credible Fear 
Amendments 
With this rule, the Departments are 
withdrawing the amendatory 
instructions that would amend 8 CFR 
208.30, 235.6, 1003.42, 1208.30, and 
1235.6 (amendatory instructions 4, 5, 6, 
7, 8, 12, 13, and 14). The Departments 
are withdrawing these portions of the 
Security Bars Final Rule because they 
conflict with the currently effective 
regulations due to amendments by 
intervening rules. Specific conflicts 
with subsequent rules are discussed in 
more detail in Section II.E of this 
preamble; more generally, however, if 
the Security Bars Final Rule were to go 
into effect, its publication of cross- 
references to the now nonexistent 8 CFR 
208.13(c)(4) and 1208.13(c)(4) would 
introduce inconsistencies in the 
regulations and create confusion as to 
the Departments’ intended procedures 
for credible fear determinations. 
Further, the setting forth of two entirely 
different processes and procedures for 
applying mandatory bars during 
credible fear screenings would interfere 
with the Departments’ ability to 
consider those bars during screenings 
and reviews. 
Additionally, amendatory instructions 
to revise five different paragraphs 
cannot be implemented as intended. 
Specifically, amendatory instructions 4, 
8, and 12 instruct OFR to revise five 
paragraphs that no longer exist: 8 CFR 
208.30(e)(5)(i)(A) and (B) and (f)(1), 
1003.42(d)(1), and 1208.30(g)(1)(ii). 
Those paragraphs existed when the 
Security Bars Final Rule was published; 
thus, OFR could have ‘‘revised’’ them as 
instructed at that time. See Document 
Drafting Handbook at 3–38 (stating that 
the amendatory term ‘‘[r]evise’’ 
‘‘[r]eplaces an existing CFR unit in its 
entirety,’’ whereas the term ‘‘[a]dd’’ 
‘‘[i]nserts new content into the CFR’’). 
However, subsequent rules removed 
those paragraphs. See Asylum Processing IFR, 87 FR 18218–19 
(amending 8 CFR 208.30 to remove 
paragraphs (e)(5)(i)(A) and (B) and 
(f)(1)); Lawful Pathways Final Rule, 88 
FR 31451 (redesignating paragraph 
(d)(1) of 8 CFR 1003.42 as paragraph (d) 
and removing and reserving paragraph 
(g)(1) in 8 CFR 1208.30). Thus, OFR 
could not amend these paragraphs as 
instructed in the Security Bars Final 
Rule and would instead add editorial 
notes to 8 CFR 208.30, 1003.42, and 
1208.30 indicating an apparent agency 
error. Cf. Document Drafting Handbook at 6–4 (noting that OFR may ‘‘add an 
editorial note of the agency error’’ in the 
context of other sorts of discrepancies in 
regulations). The addition of the 
effective text as editorial notes would 
create confusion as to the text’s validity 
and effect. 
A main goal of the Security Bars Final 
Rule was to clarify how the bars to 
asylum and withholding of removal 
relating to aliens who pose a danger to 
the security of the United States apply 
during credible fear screenings. See 85 FR 84160. Despite the Departments’ 
withdrawal of the rule’s amendments to 
their credible fear provisions, currently 
operative regulations independently 
provide a framework through which 
adjudicators may consider statutory bars 
to eligibility for asylum and 
withholding of removal, including the 
Security Bar Final Rule’s amendments 
clarifying the ‘‘danger to the security of 
the United States’’ bars, during the 
credible fear process. Notably, 8 CFR 
208.30(e)(5)(i) and (ii) provide that an 
AO may consider the mandatory bars set 
forth in section 208(b)(2)(A)(i) through 
(v) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(i)– 
(v), or section 241(b)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(B), during a credible 
fear determination. Such consideration 
includes section 208(b)(2)(A)(iv) of the 
INA, 8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(2)(A)(iv), and 
section 241(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the INA, 8 
U.S.C. 1231(b)(3)(B)(iv), which the 
Security Bars Final Rule, when 
effective, will clarify by providing that 
aliens may be ineligible for asylum and 
withholding of removal for posing a 
‘‘danger to the security of the United 
States’’ based on certain public health

DHS explained that this application would 
occur in the 2024 notice of proposed rulemaking 
that preceded the DHS Mandatory Bars Rule in 
2024. DHS Mandatory Bars Rule, 89 FR 41358 
(‘‘Should the provisions of the [Security Bars] rule 
go into effect ..., it would have implications as 
to who could constitute a security risk—as in, what 
is ‘a danger to the security of the United States.’ 
Under the Instant rule, AOs would be allowed to 
consider those provisions as part of applying the 
security bar in credible fear and reasonable fear 
screenings.’’) 
13
See, e.g., DHS, History Made, Again: Trump Administration Crushes Border Records in July 
(Aug. 1, 2025), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/08/ 
01/history-made-again-trump-administration- 
crushes-border-records-july [https://perma.cc/JRY3- KTRF] (describing continued record low border 
encounter and release numbers). 
14
The Security Bars Final Rule also states that 
third-country removals would be used in 
circumstances where aliens were ineligible for 
asylum due to the TCT Bar. See 85 FR 84181. The process for removals in that circumstance was set 
forth in amendments to 8 CFR 
208.30(e)(5)(iii)(B)(2). 
concerns.
12
Additionally, 8 CFR 
1003.42(d) provides that an Immigration 
Judge may review an AO’s credible fear 
determination de novo, including, 
where relevant, review of an AO’s 
application of any bars to asylum and 
withholding of removal. Consequently, 
both AOs and Immigration Judges may 
consider statutory bars, including the 
Security Bar Final Rule’s amendments 
clarifying the ‘‘danger to the security of 
the United States’’ bars, during the 
credible fear process without the 
Security Bar Final Rule’s amendments 
to 8 CFR 208.30, 235.6, 1003.42, 
1208.30, and 1235.6. Indeed, as 
discussed above, allowing the Security 
Bars Final Rule to become effective 
without removing the identified 
amendatory instructions may have the 
opposite effect—that is, it may interfere 
with the Departments’ ability to apply 
its amendments clarifying the ‘‘danger 
to the security of the United States’’ bars 
during credible fear screenings because 
it would result in confusing regulatory 
text and editorial notes. 
Overall, the Departments have 
determined that implementing the 
Security Bars Final Rule without 
withdrawing the above-identified 
instructions would impede the 
Administration’s success in managing 
the border.
13
If the Departments do not 
withdraw these instructions, the 
Security Bars Final Rule would create 
confusion and inconsistencies in the 
operative CFR provisions that govern 
the processing of aliens using expedited 
removal procedures. For the foregoing 
reasons, amendatory instructions 4, 6, 8, 
12, and 14 are withdrawn. The 
Departments are also withdrawing 
amendatory instructions 5, 7, and 13, 
which include authority citations 
rendered unnecessary by the 
withdrawal of the former list of 
instructions. Importantly, these 
withdrawals will have no immediate 
impact on current credible fear 
screening processes or the adjudication 
of asylum applications. 
B. Withdrawing Third-Country Removal 
Provisions 
Paragraph (f) in 8 CFR 208.16 and 
1208.16 currently reiterates that DHS 
may remove an alien granted 
withholding of removal or deferral of 
removal to a third country other than 
the country to which removal has been 
withheld or deferred. The Security Bars 
Final Rule would revise 8 CFR 208.16(f) 
and 1208.16(f) to add procedures for 
removing an alien to a third country 
‘‘prior to a determination or 
adjudication of the alien’s initial request 
for withholding or deferral of removal’’ 
in certain circumstances and set out 
parameters for the use of such authority. 
85 FR 84193–94, 84197. In practice, 
these revisions would codify a process 
to notify the alien of the potential third 
country removal and allow the alien to 
withdraw his or her initial request for 
withholding or deferral of removal to 
avoid removal to the third country. See 
85 FR 84810 (‘‘This rule provides the 
alien with the option to return to his or 
her home country rather than to seek 
withholding or deferral protection, 
which could lead to such third country 
removal.’’). If the alien did not elect to 
withdraw his or her application, then 
the alien could be removed to the third 
country unless he or she established 
that he or she would more likely than 
not face torture in the third country. 85 
FR 84194, 84197. 
Upon further consideration, the 
Departments are withdrawing these 
amendments because they could cause 
confusion and are unnecessary to 
effectuate the substantive public health- 
related provisions the Security Bars 
Final Rule will implement. 
First, the Departments are 
withdrawing the amendments to 8 CFR 
208.16(f) and 1208.16(f) to avoid 
confusion as to the possibility of third- 
country removals and the availability of 
withholding of removal under the INA 
and CAT protection from the third 
country. As noted above, the revisions 
the Security Bars Final Rule would 
make to 8 CFR 208.16(f) and 1208.16(f) 
would require the consideration of the 
likelihood of torture in the third 
country, which is the test for CAT 
protection, but not the likelihood of 
persecution on account of a protected 
ground, which is the test for statutory 
withholding of removal. See 85 FR 84194, 84197. The omission of the test 
for statutory withholding of removal 
makes sense in the context of the 
Security Bars Final Rule, which states in 
its preamble that ‘‘DHS’s discretionary 
ability to remove certain aliens to third 
countries only applies to aliens 
determined to be ineligible for asylum 
and withholding of removal pursuant to 
the danger to the security of the United 
States eligibility bars.’’
14
85 FR 84181. 
However, the regulatory text does not 
include the requirement that the alien 
be first subject to the asylum and 
withholding eligibility bars identified in 
the preamble of the Security Bars Final 
Rule. The amendments to 8 CFR 
208.16(f) and 1208.16(f) made by the 
Security Bars Final Rule could lead a 
reader to believe, incorrectly, that in all 
third-country-removal circumstances 
aliens must only be screened for a 
likelihood of torture, and not a 
likelihood of persecution, when 
relevant. To avoid the potential for 
confusion or interference with DHS’s 
ability to remove aliens to third 
countries, the Departments are 
withdrawing the amendments to 8 CFR 
208.16(f) and 1208.16(f). 
Second, these provisions are not 
necessary for DHS to effectuate third 
country removals. See INA 241(b), 8 U.S.C. 1231(b) (outlining the countries 
to which DHS may remove an alien). 
For aliens in removal proceedings, the 
Immigration Judge designates the 
country or countries of removal, in 
accordance with section 241 of the INA, 
8 U.S.C. 1231. 8 CFR 1240.10(f). If, 
during the course of proceedings, DHS 
seeks to remove an alien to a third 
country, DHS notifies the Immigration 
Judge of that new prospective country of 
removal, and, if relevant, the alien may 
seek protection from removal to that 
country. See id.; 8 CFR 1240.11(c)(1)(i). C. Unaffected Provisions 
This rule does not make any changes 
to the remainder of the Security Bars 
Final Rule. That rule makes key changes 
to 8 CFR 208.13 and 1208.13, including 
by clarifying that aliens are subject to 
the statutory bars to eligibility for 
asylum and withholding of removal 
where there are ‘‘reasonable grounds for 
regarding’’ or ‘‘reasonable grounds to 
believe that [an] alien is a danger to the 
security of the United States’’ in certain 
circumstances based on emergency 
public health concerns generated by a 
communicable disease. See 85 FR 84193–94, 84196–97 (adding clarifying 
provisions to the asylum and 
withholding of removal regulations at 8 
CFR 208.13(c)(10), 208.16(d)(2), 
1208.13(c)(10), and 1208.16(d)(2)). The

The Departments do not address comments 
seeking changes to U.S. laws, regulations, or agency 
policies that are unrelated to the changes made by 
the Security Bars Final Rule, nor does this rule 
resolve issues that are outside the scope of that 
rulemaking. 
revisions introduce specific criteria, 
such as exhibiting symptoms of a 
disease or having been exposed to the 
disease during its incubation and 
contagion period. See 85 FR 84193–94, 84196–97 (adding these criteria at 8 CFR 
208.13(c)(10)(i)(A)–(B), 
208.16(d)(2)(ii)(A)–(B), 
1208.13(c)(10)(i)(A)–(B), and 
1208.16(d)(2)(ii)(A)–(B)). The revisions 
further allow DHS, DOJ, and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services to jointly designate regions or 
countries experiencing epidemics as 
posing a public health risk to the United 
States, making aliens from those areas 
ineligible for asylum and withholding of 
removal. See 85 FR 84193–94, 84196–97 (adding this authority at 8 CFR 
208.13(c)(10)(ii)(A)–(C), 
208.16(d)(2)(iii)(A)–(C), 
1208.13(c)(10)(ii)(A)–(C), and

the revisions explicitly exempt from

IV. Public Comments on Delay IFRs and 
Responses 
As part of the second, third, and 
fourth delays of the Security Bars Final 
Rule, the Departments requested and 
received public comments addressing 
both the delay of the effective date and 
any potential future action to modify or 
rescind the Security Bars Final Rule. 
Individuals, elected officials, and non- 
governmental organizations all 
commented on the March 2021, 
December 2021, and December 2022 
delay IFRs.
16
The Departments did not 
receive any comments on the December 
2024 delay IFR.
17
The Departments 
summarize and respond to comments 
below.
18
 
A. Support for the Security Bars Final 
Rule 
Comment: Several commenters expressed support for the Security Bars 
Final Rule, stating that the clarification 
would apply in time-limited 
circumstances and its implementation 
would prioritize the public health and 
security of Americans while still 
providing protections to refugees. 
Commenters believed the Security Bars 
Final Rule would ensure that 
communicable diseases are not spread 
within the United States, thereby 
preventing Americans’ health from 
being placed at risk. Additionally, 
commenters noted that other measures 
exist to offer aliens protection. Several 
commenters stated that seeking asylum 
is a privilege and not a right and that the 
Security Bars Final Rule aligns with 
international treaties, particularly the 
1951 Convention Relating to the Status 
of Refugees, July 28, 1951, 19 U.S.T. 
6259, 189 U.N.T.S. 150 (‘‘Refugee 
Convention’’), and the INA, with one 
commenter noting that aliens are 
inadmissible to the United States if they 
‘‘have a communicable disease of public 
health significance,’’ INA 
212(a)(1)(A)(i), 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(1)(A)(i). 
Response: The Departments appreciate the commenters’ support for 
the Security Bars Final Rule. 
B. Opposition to the Security Bars Final 
Rule 
Comments: Several commenters expressed the opinion that the 
Departments were implementing the 
Security Bars Final Rule to deny 
immigration benefits, using public 
health concerns as a pretext. One 
commenter stated that the rule would 
run ‘‘the risk of continuing to perpetuate 
harmful racist stereotypes and tropes 
under the guise of public health.’’ 
Another questioned the need for the 
rule’s public health-related immigration 
restrictions, as ‘‘the vast majority of the 
pandemic-related spread stems from 
within our borders.’’ Another 
commenter argued that there was ‘‘no 
viable public health argument for this 
rule’’ and that the rule uses ‘‘false 
public health claims to justify violations 
of U.S. law and treaty obligations to 
protect refugees.’’ Another commenter 
argued that the rule ‘‘labels asylum 
seekers as threats to national security 
and prevents them from accessing life- 
saving asylum,’’ all under ‘‘the guise of 
public health.’’ One commenter stated 
that the rule ‘‘violates [the rights of 
individuals requesting asylum] under 
the mistaken guise of public health.’’ 
Another wrote that the rule ‘‘relies 
heavily on the crutch of public health 
and potential impacts on border security 
that are unsubstantiated, speculative, 
and avoidable.’’ Another commenter 
wrote that public health measures 
should be applied equally to all 
individuals entering the United States, 
and not merely for those seeking 
asylum. Another wrote that the rule 
‘‘weaponizes public health as a pretext 
for disregarding fundamental aspects of 
U.S. asylum law.’’ A few commenters 
also opined that the rule was not 
medically sound, arguing that DHS 
officials lack the medical expertise to 
make public health determinations. One 
commenter wrote that the rule would 
‘‘arbitrarily discriminate against 
individuals based on a border patrol 
agent’s uninformed medical 
determination or an individual’s 
country of origin.’’ 
Response: The Departments disagree with the commenters’ characterizations 
of the Security Bars Final Rule, which 
the Departments adopted after receiving 
and responding to comments, including 
responding to comments making 
substantively similar claims. See, e.g., 
85 FR 84167–71. The current 
rulemaking is not a reevaluation of the 
Security Bars Final Rule itself; that rule 
has already been issued through notice- 
and-comment rulemaking. Rather, this 
rulemaking addresses whether certain 
technical, non-substantive changes to 
the Security Bars Final Rule are 
necessary before the rule goes into effect 
as scheduled, as explained in Sections 
II.E and III of this preamble. 
Comments: Several commenters expressed the opinion that there were 
less restrictive means available to 
combat a public health emergency and 
that the Security Bars Final Rule could 
harm public trust by exacerbating health 
disparities among immigrant 
communities. One commenter stated 
that the rule is ‘‘sweeping in scope and 
would apply to people who present 
no—or minimal—risk to public health.’’ 
Another commenter wrote that COVID– 
19 testing and isolation could help meet 
the needs of public health while being 
less restrictive on the asylum process. 
Another commenter wrote that the rule

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61043 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations fails to consider less restrictive 
alternatives that safeguard public health 
while protecting asylum seekers, with 
one organization stating that ‘‘there are 
less restrictive measures to ensure 
public health than a complete ban on 
asylum eligibility,’’ and the Government 
should adopt those less restrictive 
measures. 
Response: The Departments disagree with the commenters’ characterizations 
of the Security Bars Final Rule, and the 
Departments already responded to 
substantively similar claims in the 
Security Bars Final Rule in response to 
comments received on the Security Bars 
NPRM. See, e.g., 85 FR 84167–71, 84173. As noted previously, this 
rulemaking is not a reevaluation of the 
Security Bars Final Rule itself. Rather, 
this rulemaking addresses whether 
certain technical, non-substantive 
changes to the Security Bars Final Rule 
are necessary before the rule goes into 
effect as scheduled. 
Comments: Some commenters opined that the Security Bars Final Rule is a 
violation of human rights law, with one 
commenter writing that rescission of the 
rule ‘‘is essential to protect the right to 
seek asylum and comply with U.S. 
domestic and international obligations.’’ 
For example, one commenter wrote that 
‘‘[d]eporting all those who come to a 
border seeking asylum without process 
and without protections violates 
asylum-seekers’ right of non- 
refoulement.’’ Another commenter 
wrote that the rule represents ‘‘the 
wholesale abdication of the U.S.’s non- 
refoulement obligations.’’ Another 
commenter stated that the rule ‘‘would 
result in the continued punishment of 
families and individuals who attempt to 
exercise their legal right to seek 
protection in the United States.’’ With 
respect to due process, one commenter 
argued that the rule denied asylum 
seekers the opportunity for a fair 
hearing by applying asylum bars during 
initial screenings and allowing DHS to 
deport individuals to third countries 
without adequate review. Several 
commenters questioned whether the 
rule would violate the treaty 
commitments of the United States, such 
as the CAT, the Refugee Convention, 
and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the 
Status of Refugees, Jan. 31, 1967, 19 
U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 268. 
Response: The Departments disagree with the commenters’ characterizations 
of the Security Bars Final Rule, and the 
Departments already responded to 
substantively similar claims in the 
Security Bars Final Rule in response to 
comments received on the Security Bars 
NPRM. See, e.g., 85 FR 84163–65, 84176, 84177–81. As noted previously, 
this rulemaking is not a reevaluation of 
the Security Bars Final Rule itself. This 
rulemaking instead addresses whether 
certain technical, non-substantive 
changes to the Security Bars Final Rule 
are necessary before the rule goes into 
effect as scheduled. 
Comments: A few commenters indicated that they believe the Security 
Bars Final Rule is discriminatory. 
Commenters stated the Security Bars 
Final Rule would ‘‘perpetuate harmful 
racist stereotypes and tropes,’’ including 
‘‘portraying immigrants as threats to 
public health and welfare.’’ Another 
commenter wrote that the rule would 
‘‘disproportionately impact victims with 
limited resources or who lack literacy in 
immigration law from accessing 
protections.’’ One commenter stated that 
the rule ‘‘diminishes the rights of all to 
be treated with the utmost compassion 
and recognized as fellow human 
beings.’’ Some commenters also claimed 
that the rule would treat asylum seekers 
with a categorical public health 
approach rather than evaluate them on 
an individual basis. 
Response: The Departments disagree with the commenters’ characterizations 
of the Security Bars Final Rule, and the 
Departments already responded to 
substantively similar claims in the 
Security Bars Final Rule in response to 
comments received on the Security Bars 
NPRM. See, e.g., 85 FR 84163–65, 84176, 84177–81. Again, this 
rulemaking is not a reevaluation of the 
Security Bars Final Rule itself. Instead, 
this rulemaking addresses whether 
certain technical, non-substantive 
changes to the Security Bars Final Rule 
are necessary before the rule goes into 
effect as scheduled. 
Comments: Commenters opined that the rule would raise the standard of 
proof applicable to migrants, including 
the burden of proof for individuals 
seeking deferral of removal under the 
CAT regulations. Commenters also 
wrote that the rule would impose an 
unreasonably high burden of proof for 
protection under those regulations, 
while another argued that the rule 
imposes unreasonable evidentiary 
burdens on asylum seekers during 
expedited proceedings, effectively 
denying them a fair opportunity to seek 
protection. 
Response: As discussed in Section III.A of this preamble, the Departments 
are withdrawing the amendatory 
instructions that would amend the 
Departments’ credible fear provisions. 
Accordingly, the provisions discussed 
by these commenters will not be 
codified. 
C. Additional Delay 
The Departments previously 
considered and addressed comments 
related to delaying the effective date of 
the Security Bars Final Rule. See 87 FR 79792–93 (December 2022 Delay IFR 
discussing and responding to comments 
related to the delayed effective date); see 
also 89 FR 105387–88 (December 2024 Delay IFR discussing and responding to 
comments related to the delayed 
effective date). As summarized in the 
December 2022 and December 2024 
Delay IFRs, some commenters 
supported further delaying the Security 
Bars Final Rule—including 
indefinitely—whereas others did not 
support further delays. 87 FR 79793; 89 
FR 105388. In the December 2022 Delay 
IFR, the Departments explained that a 
two-year delay was appropriate to 
provide time to assess the 
inconsistencies between the Security 
Bars Final Rule and other rules and for 
the promulgation of a subsequent rule 
that the Departments were considering 
at that time. 87 FR 79793. Then, in 
response to additional comments, the 
Departments in the December 2024 
Delay IFR determined that a one-year 
further delay was appropriate in light of 
the Departments’ limited resources and 
intervening regulatory priorities. 89 FR 
105388. The Departments also 
continued to welcome comments on the 
possibility of further delays, 89 FR 
105388, but the Departments did not 
receive any comments in response to the 
December 2024 Delay IFR. 
The Departments have decided that 
additional delay is not necessary. The 
Departments delayed the Security Bars 
Final Rule largely because of a 
preliminary injunction against the 
Global Asylum Final Rule and because 
allowing the Security Bars Final Rule to 
go into effect would have resulted in 
confusing regulatory text. See, e.g., 
December 2024 Delay IFR, 89 FR 
105388. The Departments have 
determined that the most effective way 
to remedy these concerns is to withdraw 
the specific portions of the Security Bars 
Final Rule that may conflict with other 
regulatory text (which will 
simultaneously withdraw the portions 
of the rule that may conflict with the 
preliminary injunction), while taking no 
further actions to interfere with other 
portions of the Security Bars Final Rule 
(in particular, the portions clarifying 
that the statutory ‘‘danger to the security 
of the United States’’ bars to eligibility 
for asylum and withholding of removal 
encompass certain emergency public 
health concerns) from becoming 
effective as scheduled. This course of 
action will both resolve the bases for

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61044 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations past delays and obviate the need for 
additional delays, without interfering 
with the public health benefits that the 
Departments sought to achieve when 
promulgating the Security Bars Final 
Rule. Thus, the Departments believe 
that further delay is unnecessary. 
V. Statutory and Regulatory 
Requirements 
A. Administrative Procedure Act 
The APA generally requires agencies 
to publish ‘‘notice of proposed rule 
making’’ in the Federal Register for a 
period of public comment unless a rule 
meets an exception to that requirement. 
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)–(B). In addition, the 
APA generally requires a 30-day delay 
to the effective date of a rule. 5 U.S.C. 
553(d). 
1. Notice and Comment 
This rulemaking satisfies the APA’s 
notice-and-comment requirement. As 
noted above in Section IV of this 
preamble, the Departments in the 
second, third, and fourth delays of the 
Security Bars Final Rule requested and 
received public comments addressing 
the delay of the effective date of the 
Security Bars Final Rule. The 
Departments also welcomed comments 
on whether to amend or rescind the 
Security Bars Final Rule in the second 
delay of the Security Bars Final Rule. 
See March 2021 Delay IFR, 86 FR 15069. Additionally, the Departments sought 
comment on the question of further 
delay in the fifth delay of the Security 
Bars Final Rule, see December 2024 Delay IFR, 89 FR 105388, but the 
Departments did not receive any 
comments in response to that request. 
As explained above in Section IV.B of 
this preamble, many comments received 
by the Departments addressed the 
underlying merits of the Security Bars 
Final Rule—a matter the Departments 
already considered when initially 
promulgating the Security Bars Final 
Rule. Some comments, however, did 
specifically address the issue of further 
delay. For example, some commenters 
argued that the Departments should 
delay the Security Bars Final Rule’s 
effective date indefinitely or for a 
significant, extended period of time and 
suggested that other legal means should 
be used to manage immigration-related 
concerns about infectious diseases 
during the delay. See December 2024 Delay IFR, 89 FR 105388 (describing 
previously received comments). 
The Departments have considered 
these comments in concluding that the 
most appropriate course of action is to 
withdraw certain provisions of the 
Security Bars Final Rule while taking no 
action to stop the remainder of the rule 
going into effect as scheduled. As 
explained previously, the Departments 
delayed the Security Bars Final Rule 
largely because of a preliminary 
injunction against the Global Asylum 
Final Rule and because allowing the 
Security Bars Final Rule to go into effect 
would have resulted in confusing 
regulatory text. See, e.g., December 2024 
Delay IFR, 89 FR 105388. The 
Departments have concluded that the 
most effective way to remedy these 
concerns is to withdraw the specific 
portions of the Security Bars Final Rule 
that may conflict with other regulatory 
text (which will simultaneously 
withdraw the portions of the rule that 
may conflict with the preliminary 
injunction) while taking no further 
actions to interfere with other portions 
of the Security Bars Final Rule (in 
particular, the portions clarifying that 
the statutory ‘‘danger to the security of 
the United States’’ bars to eligibility for 
asylum and withholding of removal 
encompass certain emergency public 
health concerns) from becoming 
effective as scheduled. This course of 
action will both resolve the bases for 
past delays and obviate the need for 
additional delays, without interfering 
with the public health benefits that the 
Departments sought to achieve when 
promulgating the rule. Thus, although 
the Departments appreciate the response 
from commenters suggesting, e.g., an indefinite delay, the Departments 
believe that further delay is 
unnecessary. 
2. Procedural Rule 
Even if the Departments had not 
complied with the notice-and-comment 
requirements of the APA, the APA’s 
notice-and-comment and delayed- 
effective-date requirements do not apply 
to ‘‘rules of agency organization, 
procedure, or practice.’’ 5 U.S.C. 
553(b)(A); 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) (providing 
that the required publication or service 
of a ‘‘substantive’’ rule shall generally 
be made not less than 30 days before its 
effective date). Courts ‘‘have used the 
term ‘procedural exception’ as 
shorthand for that exemption.’’ AFL– 
CIO v. NLRB, 57 F.4th 1023, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 2023). ‘‘[T]he critical feature of a 
rule that satisfies the . . . procedural 
exception is that it covers agency 
actions that do not themselves alter the 
rights or interests of parties, although it 
may alter the manner in which the 
parties present themselves or their 
viewpoints to the agency.’’ Id. (quoting James V. Hurson Assocs., Inc. v. 
Glickman, 229 F.3d 277, 280 (D.C. Cir. 2000)); cf. Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 176 (5th Cir. 2015) (holding 
that a rule is not procedural when it 
‘‘modifies substantive rights and 
interests’’ (quoting U.S. Dep’t of Lab. v. 
Kast Metals Corp., 744 F.2d 1145, 1153 
(5th Cir. 1984))). To determine whether 
a rule is procedural or substantive, 
courts ‘‘must look at [the rule’s] effect 
on those interests ultimately at stake in 
the agency proceeding.’’ Neighborhood 
TV Co., Inc. v. FCC, 742 F.2d 629, 637 (D.C. Cir. 1984). That said, ‘‘an 
otherwise-procedural rule does not 
become a substantive one, for notice- 
and-comment purposes, simply because 
it imposes a burden on regulated 
parties.’’ James V. Hurson Assocs., Inc., 229 F.3d at 281. Even ‘‘a rule with a 
‘substantial impact’ upon the persons 
subject to it is not necessarily a 
substantive rule under’’ the APA. Elec. 
Priv. Info. Ctr. v. DHS, 653 F.3d 1, 5 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Pub. Citizen v. 
Dep’t of State, 276 F.3d, 634, 640–41 
(D.C. Cir. 2002)). 
The Departments have determined 
that this rule regulates agency procedure 
and is therefore exempt from notice- 
and-comment and delayed-effective- 
date requirements under the APA. See 
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A); id. 553(d)(3). Although this rule does withdraw 
certain amendatory instructions of the 
Security Bars Final Rule, withdrawing 
the identified amendatory instructions 
will not alter individuals’ rights or 
interests, nor will doing so alter any 
eligibility requirements for relief or 
protection from removal or place any 
new ‘‘substantive burden[s]’’ on 
regulated parties. Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 
653 F.3d at 6; see JEM Broad. Co., Inc. 
v. FCC, 22 F.3d 320, 326 (D.C. Cir. 1994). Instead, removing such 
amendatory instructions simply avoids 
writing over regulatory amendments 
properly adopted after the Security Bars 
Final Rule was published, as described 
in Sections II.E and III.A of this 
preamble, or codifying language that 
could cause confusion, as described in 
Section III.B of this preamble, thus 
preventing the codification of confusing 
or conflicting regulatory text. The 
substance of the Security Bars Final 
Rule—i.e., that the statutory ‘‘danger to the security of the United States’’ bars 
to eligibility for asylum and 
withholding of removal encompass 
certain emergency public health 
concerns—remains unaffected by the 
changes to the Security Bars Final Rule 
adopted in this rulemaking. The 
changes made by this rulemaking 
accordingly will not affect the ‘‘rights or 
interests’’ of aliens, see AFL–CIO, 57 
F.4th at 1034, because those rights or 
interests will remain exactly the same as 
if the Security Bars Final Rule had been

Although the withdrawal of the parts of 
amendatory instructions 3 and 11 that relate to 
revisions to paragraph (f) in 8 CFR 208.16 and 
1208.16 are not the result of amendments by 
intervening rules, their removal likewise does not 
effect a change to the status quo. Withdrawing those 
amendments avoids introducing potential 
confusion as to the availability of statutory 
withholding of removal for aliens slated for removal 
under the INA, as described in Section III.B of this 
preamble. 
allowed to go into effect as scheduled 
without the changes made by this 
rulemaking. As such, this rule is a 
‘‘ ‘housekeeping’ ’’ measure that falls 
squarely within the procedural rule 
exception to the APA’s notice-and- 
comment and delayed-effective-date 
requirements. See James V. Hurson Assocs., Inc., 229 F.3d at 282 (quoting 
Nat’l Whistleblower Ctr. v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 208 F.3d 256, 263 (D.C. 
Cir. 2000)). 
Accordingly, this rule is not subject to 
the notice-and-comment and delayed- 
effective-date requirements of the APA. 
3. Good Cause 
A rule is exempt from the APA’s 
notice-and-comment requirements when 
an agency ‘‘for good cause’’ finds that 
notice and public procedure is 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). 
An agency may also forgo a delayed 
effective date ‘‘for good cause found.’’ 5 
U.S.C. 553(d)(3). The Departments have 
determined that there is good cause to 
forgo notice-and-comment procedures 
for this partial withdrawal because 
providing notice and an opportunity to 
comment is unnecessary. For the same 
reason, this rule is exempt from the 
APA’s delayed-effective-date 
requirements. 
When determining that notice and 
comment is ‘‘unnecessary,’’ the agency 
must consider whether the rule is 
‘‘insignificant in nature and impact, and 
inconsequential to . . . the public.’’ See Util. Solid Waste Activities Grp. v. EPA, 236 F.3d 749, 755 (D.C. Cir. 2001) 
(quotation omitted) (holding that notice 
and comment rulemaking was necessary 
because the regulation at issue ‘‘greatly 
expanded the regulated community and 
increased the regulatory burden’’); see 
also North Carolina Growers’ Ass’n, Inc. 
v. United Farm Workers, 702 F.3d 755, 766 (4th Cir. 2012) (describing the 
unnecessary prong as applying ‘‘when 
amendments are ‘minor or merely 
technical,’ and of little public interest’’ 
(quoting Nat’l Nutritional Foods Ass’n v. Kennedy, 572 F.2d 377, 384–85 (2d Cir. 1978))). 
Notice and comment on the 
Departments’ decision to withdraw 
specific amendatory instructions in the 
Security Bars Final Rule is unnecessary 
because rules that underwent notice and 
comment rulemaking or were exempt 
from notice and comment rulemaking, 
as described in Section II.E of this 
preamble, superseded those 
amendments while the Security Bars 
Final Rule’s effective date was delayed. 
In some instances, the intervening rules 
substantively removed provisions that 
had been implemented by the Global 
Asylum Final Rule and were set to be 
further amended by the Security Bars 
Final Rule. For example, the 
requirement to consider mandatory bars 
during credible fear screenings was 
adopted through the Global Asylum 
Final Rule, amended by the Security 
Bars Final Rule, but subsequently 
removed by the Asylum Processing IFR. 
See Section II.E.1 of this preamble. Intervening rules also affected the 
structure of the applicable CFR sections 
such that certain paragraphs that the 
Security Bars Final Rule would revise— 
in the absence of this rulemaking—no 
longer exist, as described in Section 
III.A of this preamble. Hence, as 
described in Sections II.E and III.A of 
this preamble, the substantive policy 
choices adopted in the amendatory 
instructions the Departments are 
withdrawing from the Security Bars 
Final Rule have been reversed or altered 
by intervening rules that were adopted 
after notice and comment or were 
exempt from the APA’s notice-and- 
comment requirements. Withdrawing 
these regulatory amendments 
accordingly amounts to a ‘‘technical’’ 
change, see North Carolina Growers’ Ass’n, 702 F.3d at 766, designed only to ensure that the CFR continues to 
accurately reflect the correct 
procedures—i.e., to ensure that the delayed implementation of the Security 
Bars Final Rule does not create conflicts 
with the amendments to the credible 
fear provisions that were made in the 
later-enacted rules discussed in Section 
II.E of this preamble.
19
 
As to whether there is good cause to 
forego the delayed effective date 
typically required by the APA, courts 
have asked whether the need to 
immediately implement a new rule 
outweighs regulated parties’ need to 
prepare for implementation of the rule. 
See, e.g., Riverbend Farms, Inc. v. 
Madigan, 958 F.2d 1479, 1485 (9th Cir. 1992); Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL– CIO v. Block, 655 F.2d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Here, there is no need for 
additional delay for regulated parties to 
prepare for implementation of this rule. 
Regulated parties have long been on 
notice that the Security Bars Final Rule 
was scheduled to go into effect on 
December 31, 2025; and the changes 
made to the Security Bars Final Rule by 
this current rulemaking will not require 
any time for adjustment by regulated 
parties because withdrawing certain 
portions of the Security Bars Final Rule 
will ensure only that the immigration 
adjudication system continues to 
function as it currently does. In contrast, 
delaying this rule under section 533(d) 
of the APA would risk causing 
significant confusion, as discussed 
above in Sections II.E and III of this 
preamble. 
For these reasons, the Departments 
have determined that notice-and- 
comment procedures and a delayed 
effective date are unnecessary. 
4. Foreign Affairs 
The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do 
not apply to this rule because it involves 
a ‘‘foreign affairs function of the United 
States.’’ 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1). Courts have 
held that this exception applies when 
the rule in question ‘‘clearly and 
directly involves a foreign affairs 
function.’’ E.B. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, 583 F. Supp. 3d 58, 63 (D.D.C. 2022) 
(cleaned up). In addition, although the 
text of the APA does not require an 
agency invoking this exception to show 
that such procedures may result in 
‘‘definitely undesirable international 
consequences,’’ some courts have 
required such a showing. Rajah v. Mukasey, 544 F.3d 427, 437 (2d Cir. 2008) (quotation marks omitted). This 
rule satisfies both standards. 
This rule is intended to ensure the 
Departments’ continued ability to 
process aliens using the expedited 
removal statute by avoiding conflicting 
instructions to agency personnel 
implementing the credible fear 
screening process and the removal 
process generally. See INA 235(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1). If there are conflicting 
instructions, the Departments’ ability to 
operate the expedited removal system, 
as well as the use of third-country 
removal procedures, could be 
interrupted. As recently explained when 
expanding the scope of expedited 
removal to the statutory maximum, the 
use of expedited removal ‘‘enhance[s] 
national security and public safety— 
while reducing government costs—by 
facilitating prompt immigration 
determinations.’’ Designating Aliens for 
Expedited Removal, 90 FR 8139, 8139 
(Jan. 24, 2025). The Departments believe 
that the use of expedited removal, both 
at the border and elsewhere, 
disincentivizes aliens from entering the 
United States unlawfully. If that process 
is interrupted, those disincentives may 
disappear. 
Ensuring the continued viability of 
the expedited removal process and 
third-country removal procedures

It is critical to the ability of the United States 
to remove aliens that the aliens’ countries of 
citizenship timely issue travel documents for their 
nationals for removal and that the countries 
approve removal flights from the United States. In 
bilateral engagements, this Administration has 
made it clear to other countries that it is their 
responsibility to facilitate the return of their 
nationals who do not have a legal basis to remain 
in the United States. A country’s refusal to either 
issue travel documents for its nationals or authorize 
removal flights may carry consequences. For 
example, on January 26, 2025, Colombia’s refusal to 
allow removal flights to land in Colombia led the 
United States to impose visa restrictions to indicate 
that reducing illegal immigration and removal of 
aliens with no legal right to remain in the United 
States is a critical foreign policy objective of the 
United States. See The White House, Statement from the Press Secretary (Jan. 26, 2025), https://

For example, on May 19, 2025, DHS conducted 
a voluntary charter flight from the United States to 
Honduras and Colombia, in coordination with those 
governments, for aliens who opted to self-deport. 
See DHS, Project Homecoming Charter Flight Brings Self-Deporters to Honduras, Colombia (May 19, 
2025), https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/19/ project-homecoming-charter-flight-brings-self-

representatives from their home governments, who 
also provided benefits and services to those aliens. 
See id. 
without delay avoids the possibility of 
losing momentum with international 
partners to address shared challenges to 
border security and illegal immigration. 
The United States’ border management 
strategy is predicated on the belief that 
migration is a shared responsibility 
among all countries in the region, and 
Executive Order 14150 of January 20, 
2025 (‘‘America First Policy Directive to 
the Secretary of State’’), sets out the 
President’s vision that ‘‘the foreign 
policy of the United States shall 
champion core American interests and 
always put America and American 
citizens first.’’ 90 FR 8337 (Jan. 20, 
2025). In this regard, the Administration 
is actively engaged in negotiations, 
including wide-ranging discussions 
with foreign partners, on matters related 
to border security, such as to reduce 
illegal immigration and advance 
security in the United States and the 
region. See Imposition and Collection of Civil Penalties for Certain Immigration- 
Related Violations, 90 FR 27439, 27454– 
55 & nn.48–55 (June 27, 2025) 
(discussing the Administration’s 
efforts). 
For its foreign policy efforts to 
succeed in this regard, the United States 
must demonstrate its own willingness to 
maintain its ability to use available tools 
to disincentivize, prepare for, and 
respond to ongoing migratory challenges 
and unlawful immigration. This rule 
ensures that two such critical tools— 
expedited removal and third-country 
removals—will not be potentially 
interrupted by conflicting and confusing 
regulatory provisions and so will remain 
means by which the Departments may 
deliver consequences to aliens who 
make the dangerous journey for 
purposes of entering the United States 
unlawfully. Such efforts demonstrate to 
international partners the United States’ 
commitment to ending illegal 
immigration. Although southern border 
encounters between ports of entry have 
fallen to historical lows since January 
2025,
20
this Administration has made it 
a priority to take all measures to ensure 
that DHS maintains operational control 
at the border in order to prevent 
potential illegal immigration surges, as 
occurred during the last 
Administration.
21
Loss of operational 
control of the border results in large 
numbers of migrants making the 
dangerous journey to the southern 
border through countries in the Western 
Hemisphere.
22
Therefore, delaying this 
rule’s withdrawal of the identified 
amendatory instructions to await further 
notice and comment or a delayed 
effective date could undermine the 
momentum that this Administration has 
built with foreign partners towards 
shared border security challenges. 
Moreover, the Administration is 
actively engaged in negotiations with 
other countries intended to address the 
large number of illegal aliens in the 
United States, including those who may 
be subject to expedited removal or 
removed to a third country. This 
includes various agreements that the 
Administration has signed with foreign 
governments in which those countries 
have agreed to accept third-country 
nationals, as well as their own 
nationals, upon removal.
23
The 
Administration’s negotiations also 
include discussions designed to help 
ensure that other countries issue travel 
documents for their nationals for 
removal and approve removal flights 
from the United States in a timely 
manner.
24
 
These efforts also include 
coordination with other countries to 
support the Administration’s efforts to 
encourage aliens to depart the United 
States voluntarily and return to their 
home countries, consistent with 
Presidential Proclamation 10935, 90 FR 
20357 (May 9, 2025) (‘‘Establishing 
Project Homecoming’’).
25
In sum, these 
actions indicate that the removal of 
aliens with no legal right to remain in 
the United States is a critical foreign 
policy objective of the United States. 
Here too, for these foreign policy 
efforts to succeed, the United States 
must demonstrate that it is ensuring the 
continued usability of all the tools it has 
available to help achieve the purpose of 
these international efforts and 
negotiations: to encourage other 
countries to cooperate with the United 
States’ efforts to remove illegal aliens. 
Delaying this rule’s withdrawal of the 
identified amendatory instructions 
could have undesirable consequences 
on the United States’ ongoing foreign 
policy goals, including efforts to 
encourage other countries to issue travel 
documents. Quite simply, if the United 
States is unable to demonstrate its 
continuous, effective commitment to 
taking quick and robust action to 
remove aliens, which depends on 
international cooperation, countries 
may be less inclined to engage with the

the future. 
In addition, the Department of State 
recently described the foreign affairs 
aspect of immigration in its 
determination that ‘‘efforts . . . to 
control the status, entry, and exit of 
people . . . across the borders of the 
United States’’ constitute a foreign 
affairs function of the United States 
under the APA. See Determination: Foreign Affairs Functions of the United 
States, 90 FR 12200, 12200 (Mar. 14, 
2025). In making this determination, the 
Department of State explained that 
‘‘[s]ecuring America’s borders and 
protecting its citizens from external 
threats is the first priority foreign affairs 
function of the United States’’ and noted 
that an unsecured border presents a 
range of threats to U.S. citizens, which 
can be eliminated or mitigated through 
the execution of the foreign affairs 
functions. 90 FR 12200. This rule will 
remove the potential for interruption of 
U.S. efforts to achieve the total and 
efficient enforcement of U.S. 
immigration law and, accordingly, 
champions a core American interest in 
accordance with American foreign 
policy. See id. B. Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory 
Planning and Review), Executive Order 
13563 (Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review), and Executive 
Order 14192 (Unleashing Prosperity 
Through Deregulation) 
Executive Orders 12866 (‘‘Regulatory 
Planning and Review’’) and 13563 
(‘‘Improving Regulation and Regulatory 
Review’’) direct agencies to assess the 
costs and benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. 
Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the 
importance of quantifying both costs 
and benefits, of reducing costs, of 
harmonizing rules, and of promoting 
flexibility. Executive Order 14192 
(‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation’’) directs agencies to 
significantly reduce the private 
expenditures required to comply with 
Federal regulations and provides that 
‘‘any new incremental costs associated 
with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated 
with at least 10 prior regulations.’’ 
Although this rule is not 
economically significant under section 
3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866, the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(‘‘OMB’’) has designated this rule a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ under 
section 3(f) of that order. Accordingly, 
the rule has been reviewed by OMB. 
This rule is not a regulatory action 
subject to Executive Order 14192 
because it is being issued with respect 
to an immigration-related function of 
the United States. The rule’s primary 
direct purpose is to implement or 
interpret the immigration laws of the 
United States or any other function 
performed by the Federal Government 
with respect to aliens. See OMB, Memorandum M–25–20, Guidance 
Implementing Section 3 of Executive 
Order 14192, titled ‘‘Unleashing 
Prosperity Through Deregulation’’ at 5 
(Mar. 26, 2025). 
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(‘‘RFA’’) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), as 
amended by the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996, requires an agency to prepare and 
make available to the public a regulatory 
flexibility analysis that describes the 
effect of the rule on small entities (i.e., 
small businesses, small organizations, 
and small governmental jurisdictions). 
The Departments have reviewed this 
rule in accordance with the RFA’s 
requirements and have determined that 
this rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. This rule does 
not regulate ‘‘small entit[ies]’’ as that 
term is defined in 5 U.S.C. 601(6). Only 
individuals, rather than entities, may 
seek asylum or withholding or deferral 
of removal, and only individual aliens 
are otherwise placed in immigration 
proceedings. Further, the RFA’s 
regulatory flexibility analysis 
requirements apply only to those rules 
for which an agency is required to 
publish a general notice of proposed 
rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 or 
any other law. See 5 U.S.C. 604(a). Because the Departments were 
permitted to forgo notice-and-comment 
procedures for the reasons explained in 
Section V.A of this preamble, a 
regulatory flexibility analysis is not 
required for this rule. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (‘‘UMRA’’) is intended, among 
other things, to curb the practice of 
imposing unfunded Federal mandates 
on State, local, and Tribal governments. 
Title II of UMRA requires each Federal 
agency to prepare a written statement 
assessing the effects of any Federal 
mandate in a proposed rule, or a final 
rule for which the agency published a 
proposed rule, that includes any Federal 
mandate that may result in an 
expenditure of $100 million or more 
(adjusted annually for inflation) in any 
one year by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector. See 2 U.S.C. 1532(a). This final rule does not contain a Federal 
mandate as the term is defined under 
UMRA: It does not impose any 
enforceable duty upon any State, local, 
or Tribal government or any private 
sector entity. Any downstream effects 
on such entities would arise solely due 
to the entity’s voluntary choices, and 
the voluntary choices of others, and 
would not be a consequence of an 
enforceable duty imposed by this rule. 
Similarly, any costs or transfer effects 
on State and local governments would 
not result from a Federal mandate as 
that term is defined under UMRA. The 
requirements of title II of UMRA, 
therefore, do not apply, and the 
Departments have not prepared a 
statement under UMRA. 
E. Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 
(Congressional Review Act) 
The Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs has determined that 
this rule is not a major rule as defined 
by section 804 of the Congressional 
Review Act. 5 U.S.C. 804(2). This rule 
will not result in an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more; a 
major increase in costs or prices; or 
significant adverse effects on 
competition, employment, investment, 
productivity, innovation, or on the 
ability of United States-based 
enterprises to compete with foreign- 
based enterprises in domestic and 
export markets. 
F. Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) 
This final rule does not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the 
National Government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with section 6 of Executive 
Order 13132, this rule does not have 
sufficient federalism implications to 
warrant the preparation of a federalism 
summary impact statement. 
G. Executive Order 12988 (Civil Justice 
Reform) 
This rule meets the applicable

Indian Tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian Tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian Tribes. 
I. National Environmental Policy Act 
DHS and its components analyze final 
actions to determine whether the 
National Environmental Policy Act of 
1969 (‘‘NEPA’’), 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq., 
applies to them and, if so, what degree 
of analysis is required. DHS established 
the policies and procedures that DHS 
and its components use to comply with 
NEPA in Directive 023–01 Rev. 01, 
Implementing the National 
Environmental Policy Act (Oct. 31, 
2014), https://www.dhs.gov/sites/ default/files/publications/mgmt/ 
environmental-management/mgmt-dir_
023-01-implementation-national- 
environmental-policy-act_revision- 01.pdf, and Instruction Manual 023–01– 001–01 Rev. 01, Implementation of the 
National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA) (Nov. 6, 2014) (‘‘Instruction 
Manual’’).
26
 
NEPA allows Federal agencies to 
establish, in their NEPA implementing 
procedures, categories of actions 
(‘‘categorical exclusions’’) that 
experience has shown do not, 
individually or cumulatively, have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment and, therefore, do not 
require an environmental assessment or 
environmental impact statement.
27
The 
Instruction Manual, Appendix A, lists 
the DHS Categorical Exclusions.
28
 
Under DHS NEPA implementing 
procedures, for an action to be 
categorically excluded, it must satisfy 
each of the following three conditions: 
(1) the entire action clearly fits within 
one or more of the categorical 
exclusions; (2) the action is not a piece 
of a larger action; and (3) no 
extraordinary circumstances exist that 
create the potential for a significant 
environmental effect.
29
 
This rule amends a not-yet-effective 
final rule in ways that will not change 
the current status quo and thus will not 
result in a change in the final rule’s 
environmental effect. This rule is 
strictly administrative; it amends DHS’s 
existing regulations governing credible 
fear procedures and protection 
eligibility to avoid confusion and 
conflicting regulatory text, rather than to 
change the substance of the Security 
Bars Final Rule. DHS has reviewed this 
partial withdrawal rule and finds that 
no significant impact on the 
environment, nor any change in 
environmental effect, will result from 
the amendments being promulgated in 
this partial withdrawal rule. 
Accordingly, DHS finds that the 
promulgation of this rule clearly fits 
within categorical exclusion A3 
established in DHS’s NEPA 
implementing procedures because it is 
as an administrative change with no 
change in environmental effect, is not 
part of a larger Federal action, and does 
not present extraordinary circumstances 
that create the potential for a significant 
environmental effect. Therefore, this 
rule is categorically excluded from 
further NEPA review. DOJ is adopting 
the DHS determination that this rule is 
categorically excluded under exclusion 
A3 of DHS’s Instruction Manual because 
the rule makes changes to DOJ’s 
provisions of the Security Bars Final 
Rule that are similar to those made to 
DHS’s provisions. See 42 U.S.C. 4336c (allowing an agency to adopt another 
agency’s categorical exclusion 
determination). 
J. Paperwork Reduction Act 
This rule does not adopt new, or 
revisions to existing, ‘‘collection[s] of 
information’’ as that term is defined 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995, 44 U.S.C. chapter 35, and its 
implementing regulations, 5 CFR part

Accordingly, for the reasons set forth 
in the preamble, in FR Doc. 2020–28436 
appearing on page 84160 in the Federal 
Register of Wednesday, December 23, 2020, the following corrections are 
made: 
1. On page 84193, starting in the third 
column, in part 208, amendment 3 and 
the accompanying regulatory text are 
corrected to read as follows: 
3. Amend § 208.16 by revising 
paragraph (d)(2) to read as follows: 
§ 208.16 Withholding of removal under 
section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act and 
withholding of removal under the 
Convention Against Torture. 
* * * * * 
(d) * * * 
(2) Mandatory denials—(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section, an application for 
withholding of removal under section 
241(b)(3) of the Act or under the 
regulations issued pursuant to the 
legislation implementing the 
Convention Against Torture shall be 
denied if the applicant falls within 
section 241(b)(3)(B) of the Act or, for 
applications for withholding of 
deportation adjudicated in proceedings 
commenced prior to April 1, 1997, 
within section 243(h)(2) of the Act as it 
appeared prior to that date. For 
purposes of section 241(b)(3)(B)(ii) of 
the Act, or section 243(h)(2)(B) of the 
Act as it appeared prior to April 1, 1997, 
an alien who has been convicted of a 
particularly serious crime shall be 
considered to constitute a danger to the 
community. If the evidence indicates 
the applicability of one or more of the 
grounds for denial of withholding 
enumerated in the Act, the applicant 
shall have the burden of proving by a 
preponderance of the evidence that such 
grounds do not apply. 
(ii) Public health emergencies. If a communicable disease has triggered an 
ongoing declaration of a public health 
emergency under Federal law, such as 
under section 319 of the Public Health 
Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d, or section 
564 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, 21 U.S.C. 360bbb–3, then an alien 
is ineligible for withholding of removal 
under section 241(b)(3) of the Act and 
under the regulations issued pursuant to 
the legislation implementing the 
Convention Against Torture on the basis 
of there being reasonable grounds for 
regarding the alien as a danger to the 
security of the United States under 
section 241(b)(3)(B)(iv) of the Act if the 
alien: 
(A) Exhibits symptoms indicating that 
he or she is afflicted with the disease, 
per guidance issued by the Secretary or 
the Attorney General, as appropriate; or 
(B) Has come into contact with the 
disease within the number of days 
equivalent to the longest known 
incubation and contagion period for the 
disease, per guidance issued by the 
Secretary or the Attorney General, as 
appropriate. 
(iii) Danger to the public health caused by an epidemic outside of the 
United States. If, regarding a 
communicable disease of public health 
significance as defined at 42 CFR 
34.2(b), the Secretary and the Attorney 
General, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, have jointly:

AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025–25– 
02, which applied to all aircraft 
equipped with certain Aerospace & 
Defense Oxygen Systems SaS portable 
breathing equipment (PBE). AD 2025– 
25–02 required incorporating revised 
procedures for donning the PBE. Since 
the FAA issued AD 2025–25–02, the 
agency determined the unsafe condition 
may be addressed by incorporating the 
updated procedures into documentation 
that is not identified in AD 2025–25–02 
and that certain requirements in AD 
2025–25–02 must be revised. This AD 
requires incorporating updated 
procedures for donning the PBE. The 
FAA is issuing this AD to address the 
unsafe condition on these products. 
DATES: This AD is effective January 14, 2026. 
The Director of the Federal Register 
approved the incorporation by reference 
of a certain publication listed in this AD 
as of December 24, 2025 (90 FR 56990,

Background 
The FAA issued Airworthiness 
Directive 2025–25–02, Amendment 39– 
23210 (90 FR 56990, December 9, 2025) 
(AD 2025–25–02), for all aircraft 
equipped with certain Aerospace & 
Defense Oxygen Systems SaS PBE. AD 
2025–25–02 was prompted by an MCAI 
originated by the European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which 
is the Technical Agent for the Member 
States of the European Union. EASA 
issued AD 2025–0222, dated October 13, 
2025 (EASA AD 2025–0222) (also 
referred to as the MCAI), to correct an 
unsafe condition. The MCAI states that 
occurrences of incorrect usage of PBE 
have been reported. This condition, if 
not corrected, could lead to flight or 
cabin crewmember incapacitation, 
possibly affecting crewmember 
capability to accomplish tasks during an 
emergency, or resulting in fatal injury to 
that crewmember. Relevant 
investigations identified that the PBE 
operational manual provides 
instructions that can be misunderstood 
by a flight or cabin crewmember, 
possibly leading to errors while donning 
the PBE. 
AD 2025–25–02 required 
incorporating revised procedures for 
donning PBE, part number (P/N) 15– 
40F–11 and P/N 15–40F–80, into the 
existing maintenance or inspection 
program, as applicable (for transport 
category airplanes); into maintenance 
records (for non-transport category 
aircraft that must comply with 14 CFR 
91.417(a)(2) or 135.439(a)(2)); or into the 
existing approved maintenance or 
inspection program, as applicable (for 
other non-transport category airplanes). 
The revised procedures for the proper

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61051 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations donning of PBE P/N 15–40F–11 and 
P/N 15–40F–80 prevent adverse effects 
from non-activation of the oxygen 
system, with additional warnings 
against inserting hands into the 
packaging and ensuring only the black 
neck seal is grabbed to avoid damage. 
The donning process includes detailed 
steps on deploying the hood and 
emphasizes the importance of hearing 
the oxygen flow noise immediately after 
donning. 
AD 2025–25–02 specified that, for 
non-transport category aircraft, the 
owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a 
private pilot certificate may perform the 
required action for that aircraft provided 
compliance with the applicable 
paragraph of the AD is entered into the 
aircraft maintenance records in 
accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) and 
91.417(a)(2)(v). AD 2025–25–02 stated 
that the pilot may perform this action 
because it only involves incorporating 
revised procedures for donning the PBE 
and that this action could be performed 
equally well by a pilot or a mechanic. 
AD 2025–25–02 noted that this is an 
exception to the FAA’s standard 
maintenance regulations. 
The FAA issued AD 2025–25–02 to 
address the unsafe condition on these 
products. 
Actions Since AD 2025–25–02 Was 
Issued 
Since the FAA issued AD 2025–25– 
02, the FAA determined the unsafe 
condition may be addressed by 
incorporating updated procedures into 
documentation that is not identified in 
AD 2025–25–02 and that certain 
requirements in AD 2025–25–02 must 
be revised. The FAA has revised the 
requirements in paragraph (g) of this AD 
and added optional methods of 
compliance to paragraph (h) of this AD. 
The FAA is issuing this AD to address 
the unsafe condition on these products. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5400. 
Comments on AD 2025–25–02 
The FAA issued AD 2025–25–02 as a 
final rule; request for comments. The 
FAA received numerous comments on 
AD 2025–25–02 asking for clarity on 
how to comply with the AD or 
requesting that the FAA revise the 
requirements. Commenters questioned 
the requirement to revise the 
maintenance or inspection program, 
including the requirement to replace 
pictograms, and asked whether revising 
operation manuals (end user 
instructions) are acceptable methods of 
compliance. 
Aeromexico, Air Astana, Allegiant 
Air, China Airlines, Commuteair, and 
Netjets stated that the AD requires 
revising the maintenance or inspection 
program as specified in 3.C., 
‘‘Procedure,’’ of Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025. Aeromexico and Air 
Astana noted that those procedures look 
to be for the flightcrew or apply more 
to flightcrew operational manual 
(FCOM) and operational manual (OM– 
E) for cabin crew. Allegiant Air stated 
the existing maintenance or inspection 
program revision does not apply to 
flightcrews and their procedures. China 
Airlines noted there are currently no 
maintenance or inspection procedures 
related to the PBE donning procedure 
and asked what steps are needed to 
implement this AD requirement. 
Commuteair stated the maintenance 
and inspection programs for the PBEs 
do not include requirements for 
donning or using the PBE masks. 
Commuteair noted the appropriate 
manuals for inclusion of the updated 
pictograms would be related to flight 
operations manuals, inflight manuals 
and training materials for flightcrew and 
flight attendants for PBE usage. Netjets 
asked the FAA to clarify the basis on 
which these donning operational 
procedures should be incorporated into 
the maintenance program for MSG–3 
covered aircraft. Netjets also asked if 
there is a recommended recurrent 
interval for it to be included into the 
maintenance program. 
Aeromexico asked if the inclusion of 
the aircraft operations manual (AOM) 
can be considered a method of 
compliance to AD 2025–25–02. 
Aeromexico noted the same procedures 
for the PBE are included in the AOM 
and including a copy of this can be 
considered as a correct way to give more 
security during the donning of the PBE. 
Aeromexico considered that including 
the procedures in the airplane flight 
manual (AFM) or the AOM, gives more 
value than to include them into the 
maintenance program or the inspection 
manuals. 
Allegiant Air asked if it would be 
more accurate to require the revision of 
the FCOM and/or cabin crew operating 
manual (CCOM) to incorporate the 
specific instructions from the vendor 
service bulletin since they are the end 
users of the PBEs. 
AMES–CAMO stated it does not 
understand why the aircraft 
maintenance program should be 
updated. AMES–CAMO stated the 
procedures in the service bulletin are 
purely operational procedures and are 
not maintenance procedures. AMES– 
CAMO noted that paragraph (2) of 
EASA AD 2025–0222 provides an 
acceptable method of compliance, 
which allows updating the operations 
manual of the aircraft instead of the 
maintenance program. AMES–CAMO 
asked if an amendment of the operations 
manual of the aircraft satisfies the 
requirement of paragraph (g) of FAA AD 
2025–25–02. 
Japan Airlines requested that the 
requirements in paragraph (g) of AD 
2025–25–02 be corrected because the 
procedures relate to the operation steps 
of the PBE and, therefore, should be 
reflected in the operation manual or the 
instructions to flight and cabin 
crewmembers. 
Turkish Airlines stated it has revised 
the operational manuals (FCOM and/or 
CCOM) according to Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025, and asked if that 
meets the AD 2025–25–02 requirements. 
Turkish Airlines stated that if it does 
not meet the AD 2025–25–02 
requirements, then the FAA should 
clarify what are the transport category 
airplane operators’ required actions to 
comply this AD’s requirements. 
Swift Air stated its fleet has already 
complied with EASA AD 2025–0222 by 
applying both methods of compliance: 
updating the operations manual in 
accordance with Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025, and providing the 
corresponding crew training. 
Tibet Airlines stated that in order to 
comply with the requirements of EASA 
AD 2025–0222, Tibet Airlines has 
issued technical/business notices in 
accordance with Section 3.C., 
‘‘Procedures,’’ of Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025. Tibet Airlines asked 
if the incorporation of the revised 
procedures specified in Section 3.C. 
‘‘Procedures,’’ of Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025, through the above- 
mentioned approach is acceptable to 
comply with the requirements of AD 
2025–25–02. 
Stark Airways stated they cannot find 
on this AD what exactly to do and asked 
for some clarification. 
Air France, Allegiant Air, HNA 
Technic, and Safran Aerosystems stated 
Safran Aerosystems Service Bulletin 
1540F–35–001, dated October 10, 2025, 
does not include instructions for 
replacing pictograms. Air France stated 
its understanding is that the AD 
concerns operational flight procedures 
and that there is no work to be done on 
aircraft. Allegiant Air noted that after 
reviewing the component maintenance 
manual (CMM) for P/N 15–40F–80, the 
pictogram decal pictured on the PBE 
case matches the pictograms in figures 
3 and 4 of Safran Aerosystems Service

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61052 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated October 
10, 2025. HNA Technic stated that after 
receiving EASA AD 2025–0222, they 
thought pictograms of PBE should be 
replaced, but noted that Safran did not 
agree with their opinion. Safran 
Aerosystems asked for the reason of the 
FAA requirement or if it is a mistake. 
Swift Air stated they consulted Safran 
about whether any action is required on 
the lid of the PBE packaging box, and 
that Safran confirmed to them that no 
modification to the packaging box was 
required. 
The FAA agrees that the requirement 
to revise the maintenance or inspection 
is not necessary in order to address the 
unsafe condition. The intent of this AD 
is to ensure updated procedures for 
donning the PBE are incorporated into 
applicable documentation for the 
intended user. The FAA has revised the 
requirements in paragraph (g) of this AD 
and added optional methods of 
compliance to paragraph (h) of this AD. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
This AD requires Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025, which the Director of 
the Federal Register approved for 
incorporation by reference as of 
December 24, 2025 (90 FR 56990, 
December 9, 2025). 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI and 
material referenced above. The FAA is 
issuing this AD after determining that 
the unsafe condition described 
previously is likely to exist or develop 
on other products of the same type 
design. 
AD Requirements 
This AD requires incorporating 
updated procedures for donning certain 
PBE as specified in paragraph 3.C., 
‘‘Procedure,’’ of Safran Aerosystems 
Service Bulletin 1540F–35–001, dated 
October 10, 2025. This AD also specifies 
the following optional methods of 
compliance for incorporating updated 
procedures. 
€Amend the operation manual(s), as applicable, of an aircraft by 
incorporating updated instructions for 
donning PBE P/N 15–40F–11 and P/N 
15–40F–80 as specified in paragraph 
3.C., ‘‘Procedure,’’ of Safran 
Aerosystems Service Bulletin 1540F– 
35–001, dated October 10, 2025. 
€Disseminate the content of the updated instructions specified in 
paragraph 3.C., ‘‘Procedure,’’ of Safran 
Aerosystems Service Bulletin 1540F– 
35–001, dated October 10, 2025, to all 
flight and cabin crewmembers of an 
aircraft. 
Justification for Immediate Adoption 
and Determination of the Effective Date 
Section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 et 
seq.) authorizes agencies to dispense 
with notice and comment procedures 
for rules when the agency, for ‘‘good 
cause,’’ finds that those procedures are 
‘‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest.’’ Under this 
section, an agency, upon finding good 
cause, may issue a final rule without 
providing notice and seeking comment 
prior to issuance. Further, section 
553(d) of the APA authorizes agencies to 
make rules effective in less than thirty 
days, upon a finding of good cause. 
An unsafe condition exists that 
requires the immediate adoption of this 
AD without providing an opportunity 
for public comments prior to adoption. 
The FAA has found that the risk to the 
flying public justifies forgoing notice 
and comment prior to adoption of this 
rule because incorrect usage of PBEs 
could lead to flight or cabin 
crewmember incapacitation, possibly 
affecting crewmember capability to 
accomplish tasks during an emergency, 
or resulting in fatal injury to that 
crewmember. The PBEs are designed to 
protect the user’s eyes and respiratory 
tract in a contaminated atmosphere, 
which provides the ability to locate and 
combat a fire. Additionally, the 
compliance time in this AD is shorter 
than the time necessary for the public to 
comment and for publication of the final 
rule. Accordingly, notice and 
opportunity for prior public comment 
are impracticable and contrary to the 
public interest pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 
553(b). 
In addition, the FAA finds that good 
cause exists pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) 
for making this amendment effective in 
less than 30 days, for the same reasons 
the FAA found good cause to forgo 
notice and comment. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) do not apply when 
an agency finds good cause pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without 
prior notice and comment. Because FAA 
has determined that it has good cause to 
adopt this rule without prior notice and 
comment, RFA analysis is not required. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD 
affects approximately 80,000 appliances 
installed on but not limited to transport 
category airplanes. The FAA estimates 
the following costs to comply with this 
AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS FORREQUIREDACTIONS 
Labor cost Parts cost Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
1 work-hour × $85 per hour = $85 .................................................................................. $0  $85  Up to $6,800,000.* * It is unknown how many of the 80,000 appliances are installed on U.S.-registered aircraft. 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action.

our allies while reducing the regulatory 
burden for exporters, in support of the 
President’s Executive Order 14268 of 
April 9, 2025, ‘‘Reforming Foreign 
Defense Sales to Improve Speed and 
Accountability’’. In this rule the 
Department of State (the Department) 
finalizes, with changes, the interim final 
rule published on August 20, 2024. The 
interim final rule made several 
amendments to the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations (ITAR), pursuant to 
section 38(l) of the Arms Export Control 
Act (AECA), to facilitate defense trade 
and cooperation among Australia, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States, 
including through a new exemption to 
the licensing requirements of the ITAR. 
The Department is also now responding 
to public comments received on the 
interim final rule. 
DATES: The rule is effective December 30, 2025.

Exemption. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In support of the President’s Executive Order on 
‘‘Reforming Foreign Defense Sales to 
Improve Speed and Accountability,’’ the 
Department is publishing this rule to 
streamline defense trade and facilitate 
cooperation among our allies while 
reducing the regulatory burden for 
exporters. Further, the Department is 
responding to public comments 
received pursuant to the interim final 
rule (89 FR 67270), which created new 
efficiencies within the ITAR. The 
interim final rule implemented new 
authorities provided in section 38(l) of 
the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2778(l)), as added 
by section 1343 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal 
Year 2024 (Pub. L. 118–31). Specifically, 
it added § 126.7, which previously had 
been reserved, to create the exemption 
for defense trade and cooperation 
among Australia, the United Kingdom 
(UK), and the United States (‘‘the 
§ 126.7 exemption’’). The § 126.7 
exemption states that no license or other 
approval is required for the export, 
reexport, retransfer, or temporary import 
of defense articles, the performance of 
defense services, or engaging in 
brokering activities between or among 
Authorized Users within the physical 
territory of Australia, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States 
provided certain requirements and 
limitations are met. The rule also 
created a new Supplement No. 2 to Part 
126, an Excluded Technology List 
(ETL), that lists the defense articles and 
defense services ineligible for transfer 
pursuant to the § 126.7 exemption. 
Further, the Department added 
§ 126.18(e) for transfers of classified 
defense articles to dual nationals who 
are citizens of Australia and the United 
Kingdom and another country, provided 
all relevant criteria are met. The 
Department also added § 126.15(c) and 
(d), which implemented expedited 
license processing for exports of defense 
articles and defense services to 
Australia, the United Kingdom, and 
Canada. 
The Department acknowledges and 
appreciates the comments submitted in 
response to the interim final rule and is 
now publishing this final rule to address 
these comments. 
In response to comments received, the 
primary changes to regulatory text in 
this rulemaking are as follows: 
€In ITAR § 126.7, the section heading is revised to ‘‘Exemptions’’ to account 
for a new and separate exemption for 
reexports, retransfers, or temporary 
imports of defense articles to support 
the armed forces of Australia, the 
United Kingdom, or the United States, 
provided certain requirements are met. 
Titles have been added to the 
paragraphs found in § 126.7 to clearly 
delineate each exemption and their 
associated requirements and limitations. 
Additionally, the phrase ‘‘other 
approval’’ is removed in this section. 
€In ITAR § 126.7(a), the term ‘‘furnishing’’ replaces the phrase ‘‘the 
performance’’ in order to be consistent 
with existing language in the ITAR 
regarding defense services. In ITAR 
§ 126.7(b)(2), language is added so that 
a United Kingdom or Australian 
government department or agency is 
identified as a transferor, recipient, or 
broker in § 126.7(b)(2), and language 
pertaining to U.S. persons registered 
with the applicable Directorate of 
Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) 
registration is changed from ‘‘not 
debarred under § 127.7’’ to ‘‘eligible 
under § 120.16’’ to account for all 
reasons a U.S. person may be ineligible 
to use the § 126.7 exemption. 
€In ITAR § 126.7, paragraphs (c) and (d) are added for a new exemption for 
certain reexports, retransfers, or 
temporary imports of defense articles to 
support the armed forces of Australia, 
the United Kingdom, or the United 
States. 
€In ITAR §§ 126.7 and 126.18, the phrase ‘‘Authorized User’’ replaces the 
phrase ‘‘authorized user’’ for 
consistency throughout the regulations. 
€In ITAR § 126.18(e), ‘‘Australian or United Kingdom parties described in 
§ 126.7(b)(2)(ii) or (iii) or are regular 
employees thereof’’ replaced 
‘‘authorized users or regular employees 
of an authorized user of the exemption 
in § 126.7’’ because the parties 
described in § 126.7(b)(2) expanded 
with the addition of a United Kingdom 
national-level government department 
or agency or Australian federal 
government department or agency. 
The Department notes separately that 
in the spirit of promoting defense trade 
between and among Australia, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States 
during the initial implementation of the 
§ 126.7 exemption, the Department 
began expediting all export licensing 
adjudications for Australia and the 
United Kingdom on September 1, 2024, 
when the interim final rule became 
effective, regardless of whether a license 
application met the eligibility criterion 
in ITAR § 126.15(c). The Department 
now notes over 700 entities from 
Australia and the United Kingdom have 
become Authorized Users and industry 
from all three countries have, over the 
last year, utilized and familiarized 
themselves with the ITAR § 126.7 
exemption. Now that industry has 
become better acquainted with the 
§ 126.7 exemption and as it has become 
more readily available for widespread 
industry use due to the growing number 
of Authorized Users, the Department is 
now processing expedited licensing 
requests based on the eligibility 
criterion of § 126.15(c), which states 
expedited licensing is available for an 
export that cannot be undertaken under 
an exemption. 
Although outside the scope of this 
rulemaking, comments received related 
to the Authorized User Terms and 
Conditions and subsequent changes the 
Department has made to these terms and 
conditions facilitate use of the § 126.7 
exemption are addressed in detail 
below. The Authorized User Terms and 
Conditions are the compliance 
requirements Australian and United 
Kingdom parties agree to as part of the 
process to become an Authorized User. 
A detailed review and response to the 
public comments submitted in the 
interim final rule, organized by ITAR 
section, is as follows. 
ITAR § 126.7: Exemption for Defense 
Trade and Cooperation Among 
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States 
Three commenters recommended 
expanding the § 126.7 exemption 
outside of the physical territories of

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61055 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Australia, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States in support of Australia, 
the United Kingdom, or the United 
States’ armed forces or Authorized 
Users deploying overseas to support 
those armed forces. Another commenter 
recommended including the modified 
§ 126.7 in § 126.1(a), which describes 
exceptions to the policy of denial the 
Department holds toward certain 
proscribed destinations. Also, another 
commenter recommended that § 126.7 
mirror § 120.54(a)(6). The Department 
declines to accept all of these comments 
in full and reiterates that the scope of 
the § 126.7 exemption was defined 
pursuant to AECA section 38(l)(1)(C)(2), 
which did not include transfers outside 
of Australia, the United Kingdom, or the 
United States. However, based on these 
comments and consultations with 
Australia and the United Kingdom, the 
Department is adding a new and 
separate exemption found in § 126.7 for 
reexports, retransfers, or temporary 
imports of defense articles to support 
the armed forces of Australia, the 
United Kingdom, or the United States, 
provided certain requirements are met. 
Two commenters recommended 
removing the provisions in § 126.7(b)(4) 
that relate to sections 36(c) and 36(d) of 
the AECA regarding congressional 
certifications. The Department declines 
to accept this recommendation as those 
provisions are required by law. 
One commenter sought confirmation 
that the provision of defense services 
authorized via a mechanism other than 
a Technical Assistance Agreement 
(TAA) or Manufacturing License 
Agreement (MLA), including the § 126.7 
exemption, does not subject the 
resultant foreign-origin defense article 
to the ITAR or its reexport and 
retransfer requirements. The 
Department states that, pursuant to the 
Authorized User Terms and Conditions, 
defense articles produced or 
manufactured from technical data or 
defense services exported from the 
United States via the § 126.7 exemption 
are subject to reexport and retransfer 
requirements under the ITAR. Such 
reexport or retransfer may be 
authorized, however, pursuant to the 
§ 126.7 exemption. Additionally, the 
interim final rule (89 FR 67270) 
amended § 124.8(a)(5) to enable the 
transfer of defense articles produced or 
manufactured pursuant to such 
agreements pursuant to the § 126.7 
exemption. If such an agreement does 
not include the updated § 124.8(a)(5) 
clause referencing § 126.7, the U.S. 
agreement holder may submit a minor 
amendment to update the subject clause 
if they want to utilize the § 126.7 
exemption as the authorization for a 
reexport or retransfer. 
One commenter sought clarification 
as to whether an item exported from the 
United States to an Authorized User 
using a DSP–5 license in furtherance of 
a Warehouse and Distribution 
Agreement (WDA) and later 
retransferred to an eligible recipient 
under the § 126.7 exemption would 
need to be included in the WDA annual 
sales report. As an initial matter, the 
Department notes that § 124.14(b)(2) 
requires applicants to include a detailed 
statement of the terms and conditions 
under which defense articles licensed 
under the WDA will be exported and 
distributed. Unless the § 126.7 
exemption is identified as a likely 
method of authorizing distribution, 
transfers of defense articles licensed 
under a WDA should not occur. 
Assuming that the § 126.7 exemption 
has been identified in the WDA, items 
retransferred pursuant to § 126.7 should 
be included in the WDA annual sales 
report. 
The same commenter inquired as to 
where Directorate of Defense Trade 
Controls (DDTC) guidance may be found 
regarding the Australian, Canadian, and 
United Kingdom’s exclusion from 
signing DSP–83’s. The Department 
notes, specifically with respect to 
exports undertaken pursuant to the 
country exemptions for Australia, 
Canada, and the United Kingdom, the 
text of § 123.10(a) was amended by the 
interim final rule (89 FR 67270) to 
exclude §§ 126.5 and § 126.7. 
The same commenter asked whether 
transfers pursuant to cooperative 
programs are eligible under the § 126.7 
exemption. The Department notes that 
the § 126.7 exemption is only available 
for qualifying transfers that rely on the 
ITAR as the transfer authority. 
One commenter asked, in a scenario 
in which an item is exported under the 
authorities in § 126.7 to the United 
Kingdom and the United Kingdom later 
needs to reexport the item to another 
country, whether the reexport 
authorization request should go to the 
United States or the United Kingdom. 
Similarly, if the item is being reexported 
to a country that is not Australia, the 
United Kingdom, or the United States, 
the commenter asked if a DSP–5 should 
be sought in order to cover the initial 
export from the United States to the 
United Kingdom and any subsequent 
reexport to another country. The 
Department clarifies that provided all 
criteria are met, the § 126.7 exemption 
is available for use for the initial export, 
but the exporter may still elect to apply 
for a license if it prefers. If the defense 
article later needs to be reexported from 
the United Kingdom to a third country, 
reexport authorization from the 
Department would be required, whether 
in the form of a license or another 
authorization such as an exemption. 
The Department defers to the UK 
government on the question of whether 
it would also impose a licensing 
requirement on the export of the defense 
article from the United Kingdom. 
One commenter asserted that 
individuals must be regular employees 
to use the § 126.7 exemption and that 
certain contractors for the UK and 
Australian governments do not meet the 
definition of regular employee found at 
§ 120.64 as they are sole proprietors. 
The same commenter recommended 
amending § 120.64 with a new 
paragraph stating that the ‘‘[s]taffing 
agency includes other contract 
employee providers and individuals 
trading as a sole proprietorship and 
seconded by the staffing agency and 
meet all requirements of § 120.64(a)(2) 
are deemed to be a regular employee.’’ 
Further, the commenter requested the 
Department publish a frequently asked 
questions (FAQ) clarifying that contract 
employees include foreign persons who 
meet the definition of a regular 
employee in § 120.64. The Department 
declines to accept the commenter’s 
recommendations and clarifies that 
there is no requirement to be a regular 
employee to use the § 126.7 exemption, 
nor is the definition of regular employee 
limited to U.S. persons. Pursuant to 
§ 126.7(b)(2), the parties described are 
eligible to use the § 126.7 exemption 
provided all other criteria are met. 
One commenter asked for more 
information about the security and 
handling requirements for defense 
articles, including technical data, for 
Authorized Users in Australia. The 
same commenter asked if marking 
documents is required, and if Note 1 to 
§ 126.7(b)’s reference to the Australian 
Government Protective Security Policy 
Framework is the only security 
requirement. The Department clarifies 
that Note 1 to paragraph (b) of § 126.7 
reminds the public that the exemption 
does not remove any other U.S. 
statutory and regulatory requirements. 
The listed requirements are examples, 
not an exhaustive list of security 
requirements. Further, there are no 
specific marking requirements in the 
§ 126.7 exemption. Regarding 
Australia’s security and handling 
requirements, the Department cannot 
opine on laws or regulations outside its 
jurisdiction. 
One commenter sought confirmation 
that classified transfers are allowed 
under the § 126.7 exemption. The 
Department confirms that classified

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61056 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations transfers (e.g., exports, reexports, retransfers, etc.) are allowed under 
§§ 126.7 and 126.18, provided the 
relevant exemption’s criteria are met. 
One commenter asserted that DDTC’s 
registration acknowledgement letter 
does not identify U.S. affiliates or 
subsidiaries and thus does not confirm 
that an affiliate or subsidiary is included 
as part of a U.S. person’s registration. 
The same commenter recommended 
publishing a FAQ on the DDTC website 
confirming that U.S. affiliates or 
subsidiaries identified in block 8 of the 
DS–2032 form are eligible to use the 
exemption as part of the parent’s 
registration. Further, the commenter 
recommended modifying DDTC’s 
registration acknowledgement letter to 
include any U.S. affiliates or 
subsidiaries from the DS–2032, allow 
Authorized Users to have DECCS 
accounts, and create a feature for users 
to search for U.S. registrants including 
affiliates and subsidiaries. DDTC is 
publishing an FAQ on its website to 
clarify that U.S. subsidiaries and 
affiliates of U.S. person DDTC 
registrants listed in block 8 of the DS– 
2032 are eligible to self-certify to 
exemption usage and meets the 
registration requirement of 
§ 126.7(b)(2)(i). 
ITAR § 126.15: Expedited Processing of 
License Applications for the Export of 
Defense Articles and Defense Services 
to Australia, the United Kingdom, or 
Canada 
One commenter asserted that the U.S. 
allies, including Canada, who are 
eligible for expedited processing for 
export license applications pursuant to 
the provisions of § 126.15 should be 
treated the same for purposes of the 
ITAR. The Department notes the 
National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2024 called for expedited 
licensing for the United Kingdom, 
Australia, and Canada. It also separately 
created section 38(l) of the AECA, 
which ultimately resulted in the 
creation of a defense trade exemption 
for the United Kingdom and Australia. 
The Department implemented what was 
required by law, and the inclusion of 
Canada within the framework of the 
exemption described in section 38(l) of 
the AECA was not included in the law. 
The Canadian exemption in § 126.5 
exists pursuant to different authority 
under the AECA, and the provisions of 
section 38(l) of the AECA do not extend 
to transfers to or from Canada. 
One commenter sought clarification 
regarding whether the expedited 
processing of license applications 
described in § 126.15(c) and (d) applies 
to all United Kingdom and Australian 
companies or only Authorized Users. 
The Department confirms that the 
expedited procedures apply to all 
parties in the United Kingdom, 
Australia, and Canada. The same 
commenter requested that the expedited 
processing of license applications also 
apply to General Correspondence 
requests submitted by Australian and 
UK companies. The Department 
declines to accept this recommendation 
as the expediting requirement set forth 
in section 1344 of the NDAA for Fiscal 
Year 2024 (22 U.S.C. 10423) applies to 
exports and not other types of transfers 
(e.g., reexports or retransfers) that would be authorized via General 
Correspondence. 
One commenter suggested the 
Department create an Open General 
License for the reexport and retransfer 
of unclassified defense articles, in 
support of AUKUS, among Australia, 
the United Kingdom, the United States 
and allied countries, such as NATO and 
Five Eyes partners, allowing for 
retransfers and reexports to be 
authorized by the country of reexport or 
retransfer rather than the country of 
origin. Alternatively, if the Department 
is not amenable to this suggestion, the 
commenter recommended amending 
§ 126.15(c) and (d) to apply to reexports 
to third country partners if the end-use 
is in support of AUKUS. The 
Department declines to accept these 
suggestions. The expedited procedures 
set out in section 1344 of the NDAA for 
Fiscal Year 2024 and implemented in 
the ITAR were intended to facilitate 
defense trade between the United States, 
the United Kingdom, and Australia, not 
reexports from those countries to 
additional countries. 
One commenter recommended that a 
Department decision to deny a license 
application or return without action 
(RWA) a license application be a 
decision made at the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary (DAS) level. Further, the same 
commenter recommended the DDTC 
DAS review on a monthly or quarterly 
basis those license applications that 
have been adjudicated but not 
approved, in order to ensure that license 
applications are not being rejected 
because the statutorily required 
timeframes are approaching. This 
comment is outside the scope of the 
current rulemaking as it addresses 
internal Department processes and 
procedures and sections of the ITAR 
that are not the subject of this 
rulemaking. Furthermore, the 
recommendations are unnecessary and 
duplicative. ITAR § 120.1(b)(2)(i) 
delegates to the Director of the Office of 
Defense Trade Controls Licensing 
(DTCL) the responsibilities related to 
licensing. The DTCL Director already 
routinely reviews all licenses 
recommended for denial and tracks in 
real time all licenses subject to the 
expedited review procedures. The 
Department has not to date, and has no 
plans in the future, to implement a 
policy of denying or returning without 
action license applications because the 
statutorily required timeframes are 
approaching. Furthermore, all license 
applications that are returned without 
action are also subject to secondary 
review procedures to ensure consistent 
treatment and determine whether an 
incomplete or defective license 
application can be salvaged. For these 
reasons, the Department declines to 
accept the recommendations. 
One commenter recommended 
changing the expedited license 
processing timelines found in 
§ 126.15(d) to 15 days and 21 days, 
respectively, for applications related to 
government-to-government agreements 
and all other applications. The 
Department declines to accept this 
comment as the 30- and 45-day license 
application timeframes were established 
by statute in the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. 
ITAR § 126.18: Exemptions Regarding 
Intracompany, Intra-Organization, and 
Intragovernmental Transfers to 
Employees Who Are Dual Nationals or 
Third-Country Nationals 
One commenter asked what qualifies 
as a SECRET level security clearance 
under § 126.18(d) and if security 
clearances required under § 126.18(d) 
are different than those under 
§ 126.18(e). The Department notes that 
§ 126.18(d) is reserved for the reexport 
of unclassified defense articles or 
defense services. There is no security 
clearance requirement in this portion of 
the exemption. The relevant 
requirement in § 126.18(e) is for a UK or 
Australian dual national to hold a 
security clearance approved by 
Australia, the United Kingdom, or the 
United States that is equivalent to the 
classification level of SECRET or above 
in the United States. That differs from 
§ 126.18(c), which states a qualifying 
condition is a security clearance 
approved by the host nation government 
for its employees. 
One commenter sought clarification 
regarding whether a dual citizen of both 
the United States and Australia is 
considered a dual national for purposes 
of § 126.18(e). The Department confirms 
§ 126.18(e) is available in the case of a 
dual citizen of the United States and 
Australia. 
One commenter inquired whether 
§ 126.7 should be read with § 126.18(d), 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:11 Dec 29, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00022 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30DER1.SGM 30DER1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61057 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations but exclusive of ITAR § 126.18(e). The 
Department clarifies that § 126.7, 
§ 126.18(d) and § 126.18(e) are all 
separate ITAR exemptions. ITAR 
§ 126.7(b)(2) lists who may be eligible to 
use the § 126.7 exemption, § 126.18(d) 
authorizes transfers to dual and third- 
country nationals provided all other 
criteria are met for the exemption, and 
§ 126.18(e) is available to dual nationals 
of the United Kingdom or Australia 
provided all other criteria are met for 
the exemption. 
Supplement No. 2 to Part 126— 
Excluded Technology List 
Multiple commenters expressed 
appreciation for the work of all three 
governments to refine the Excluded 
Technology List (ETL) from what was 
initially published in the proposed rule. 
The Department notes, as a threshold 
matter, that it monitored licensing 
requests for Australia or the United 
Kingdom against the ETL over a three- 
month period and assesses 
approximately 18% of such licensing 
requests would not be eligible for 
transfer under the exemption because of 
the ETL. The Department has expedited 
those licensing requests with an average 
processing time of 16.6 days. Multiple 
commenters requested additional efforts 
to align the ETL for the § 126.7 
exemption with the ETLs implemented 
by Australia and the United Kingdom. 
The Department continues to work with 
its international partners to more clearly 
align the three ETLs where practicable. 
However, due to differences in the 
underlying export control lists, the three 
ETLs will not align perfectly and each 
partner must maintain its own 
implementation to account for 
differences in national legal and policy 
requirements and to remain agile in 
adapting to revisions of its own national 
regulations. 
One commenter, in expressing 
appreciation for the Department’s 
commitment to periodic reviews of the 
ETL, encouraged the Department to 
continue to engage with industry and 
open another comment period 
specifically for further review of the 
ETL. The Department values the 
industry contributions in the two prior 
comment periods and declines to open 
another comment period at this time, 
although it may issue a request for such 
comment at a future date. 
Two commenters criticized the ETL as 
burdensome, without identifying 
specific examples of where the list is 
overly burdensome or suggestions for 
changes to the list. The Department has 
committed to an annual review of the 
ETL for the first five years after 
implementation, and periodically 
thereafter. 
One commenter requested more 
transparency when updates to the ETL 
are made either by website posting or 
utilizing other technologies to release 
updates to the public. The Department 
notes that any future changes to the ETL 
will be published in the Federal 
Register. 
Two commenters suggested revising 
ETL entries to clarify the scope of 
excluded technical data and defense 
services. The first recommended 
rewording the ETL entry for United 
States Munitions List (USML) Category 
XVIII to clarify it excludes ‘‘classified 
technical data and defense services 
directly related to classified articles 
specially designed for counter-space 
operations,’’ and not ‘‘all classified 
USML Category XVIII technical data and 
defense services,’’ asserting that the 
semicolon after ‘‘counter-space 
operations’’ creates confusion. The 
commenter specifically suggests the 
entry is unclear as to whether the final 
clause refers only to the antecedent 
‘‘Classified articles described in USML 
Category XVIII specially designed for 
counter-space operations’’ or if it refers 
to the entire USML category. The 
Department declines to revise this entry 
and notes its use of the semicolon in 
this entry is consistent both with usage 
throughout the ETL and the 
Department’s intent. Specifically, use of 
the adjective phrase ‘‘directly related 
[to]’’ requires an object. As in the other 
ETL entries, ‘‘directly related technical 
data and defense services’’ refers to all 
antecedent defense articles within the 
entry. An example where the 
Department intends to exclude technical 
data for all articles in a USML category 
is found in the ETL entry for USML 
Category XVI. The second commenter 
requested specific revisions of the ETL 
entry for Category XI(a)(4)(i), (c)(1) 
through (3), and (d), to provide that only 
‘‘classified, directly related classified 
technical data and classified defense 
services to the previously proposed 
exclusions’’ are excluded. The 
Department declines to do so, assessing 
the entry is already sufficiently clear 
and concise, and consistent with entries 
throughout the ETL. Because ‘‘directly 
related’’ in this entry modifies both 
‘‘technical data’’ and ‘‘defense services,’’ 
‘‘classified,’’ must similarly modify 
both. Thus, the excluded technical data 
and defense services in this entry 
comprise: classified technical data 
directly related to the articles identified 
in the preceding clause(s) and classified 
defense services directly related to the 
articles identified in the preceding 
clause(s). 
One commenter encouraged DDTC to 
limit the ETL entry for MT-designated 
articles and services only to the 
exclusions outlined in AECA subsection 
(j)(1)(C)(ii). That commenter and one 
other requested amendment of that ETL 
entry to apply only to complete 
unmanned aerial systems (UAS). The 
first commenter proposed using 
language it previously suggested in 
response to the proposed rule. As it did 
in the interim final rule, the Department 
again declines to rely on the regulated 
community to interpret elements of the 
AECA and Missile Technology Control 
Regime (MTCR), including the term ‘‘for 
use in rocket systems,’’ for the purposes 
of authorizing exports. One of the 
commenters asserted industry regularly 
interprets whether MTCR controls 
apply; however, discrepancies in MT 
designations for license application 
submissions do not carry the same risk 
as discrepancies in self-assessing 
whether a technology may be exported 
as required by the exemption. The 
Department previously removed USML 
entries with an ‘‘MT’’ designation from 
the MTCR entry on the ETL when the 
USML entry (1) does not include MTCR 
Category I commodities and (2) does not 
include MTCR Category II commodities 
for use in rockets. 
One commenter also requested the 
Department consider carving out USML 
Category IV(d)(3) in the same manner as 
the Department previously carved out 
USML Category VIII(h)(12) from the 
MTCR entry. The Department declines 
to do so and notes the articles described 
in USML Category IV(d)(3) are described 
in Item 20.A.1.b of the MTCR Annex. 
Because paragraph (d)(3) describes 
MTCR Category II commodities for 
missiles, rockets, and space launch 
vehicles, the Department affirms that 
articles described in that entry are not 
eligible for transfer under the § 126.7 
exemption. 
Two commenters suggested revisions 
to the USML Category I through XX 
anti-tamper (AT) entry on the ETL. One 
commenter recommended expanding 
this entry to exclude AT technologies 
verified and validated by the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) to control 
those technologies that are not U.S. 
Programs of Record and do not have a 
DoD Program Protection Plan. Having 
consulted with DoD, the Department 
declines to expand the ETL as 
requested. Another commenter 
recommended revising the exclusion to 
clarify it does not exclude articles with 
AT features that are already installed in 
a major component they are designed to 
protect, similar to those installed in 
end-items. The Department declines to 
do so and notes that components and

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61058 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations end-items are already both included in 
the definition of a commodity at 
§ 120.40(a). Thus, articles having 
excluded anti-tamper features that are 
already installed in the commodity, 
including components and end items, 
they are designed to protect, are not 
currently excluded by this ETL entry. 
One commenter noted the control text 
of USML Category XI(a)(3)(xxix) refers 
to paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(13) of USML 
Category VIII, which are currently 
reserved. The Department thanks the 
commenter for this observation and 
notes this does not materially affect the 
operation of the USML or the ETL. 
Although updates to the USML are 
outside the scope of this rulemaking, the 
Department is tracking this issue for 
future updates to the USML. 
One commenter recommended the 
Department ‘‘streamline’’ the entry that 
currently applies to paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of Category XI by removing 
references to paragraph (d) technical 
data and defense services. The 
commenter proposed language that does 
not appear to differ from the current 
ETL. The Department declines to 
remove the references to technical data 
and defense services, as it would 
inappropriately reduce the scope of the 
exclusion. 
One commenter requested the 
Department clarify that defense services 
furnished by a U.S. Authorized User 
based solely on information furnished 
by an Australian or UK Authorized User 
are not excluded by the ETL. The 
Department declines to do so, as the 
request is overly broad and would 
complicate compliance efforts. 
Furthermore, the Department notes one 
of the reasons it regulates defense 
services is its interest in ensuring the 
use of U.S. expertise and know-how is 
consistent with U.S. national security 
and foreign policy objectives, even if no 
technical data is transferred. The 
commenter specifically posed a 
hypothetical scenario in which the 
Australian Department of Defence 
(ADoD) hires a U.S. company to provide 
advisory services that constitute a 
defense service directly related to a 
USML Category XI(b) defense article. 
According to the hypothetical, to 
furnish these services, the U.S. company 
must review classified information 
furnished by the ADoD, directly related 
to articles described in USML Category 
XI(b). The commenter asserted the U.S. 
company may not rely on the exemption 
provided at § 126.7 due to the ETL entry 
that excludes classified articles 
described in USML Category XI(b) and 
classified, directly related technical data 
and defense services. As a result, the 
U.S. company must seek a technical 
assistance agreement (TAA) for this 
service, even though it does not plan to 
export any hardware, software, 
technical data, or information about 
U.S. Government (USG) systems or 
methods. The Department affirms that 
classified defense services directly 
related to a classified USML Category 
XI(b) defense article are not eligible to 
be furnished under the § 126.7 
exemption, even if those services do not 
involve the transfer or use of U.S.-origin 
hardware or technical data. However, 
the Department also clarifies that 
classified defense services are those that 
meet the definition of ‘‘classified’’ in 
§ 120.38. Thus, defense services are not 
‘‘classified’’ solely on the basis that the 
service involves the use of classified 
information or classified hardware. The 
Department also notes it has committed 
to, and is currently meeting, expedited 
licensing timelines pursuant to § 126.15, 
which should facilitate U.S. companies 
obtaining any necessary licenses or 
agreements. 
One commenter inquired whether the 
§ 126.7 exemption places limits on the 
figure of merit (FOM) for night vision 
devices transferred under the 
exemption. The Department observes 
the ETL does not currently exclude 
articles based on FOM criteria. Note that 
all applicable ETL entries must be 
reviewed to determine whether a 
particular defense article is eligible for 
transfer pursuant to the exemption. 
One commenter requested 
clarification regarding whether the 
§ 126.7 exemption allows exports of 
unclassified technical data regarding 
USG cryptographic devices that have 
not yet been certified and not yet 
approved for foreign release by the 
appropriate USG entities. The 
Department affirms the referenced ETL 
entry is not intended to exclude 
unclassified technical data or articles 
related to USG cryptographic devices. 
However, the § 126.7 exemption 
pertains specifically to ITAR license 
requirements. It does not relieve 
exporters of the obligation to comply 
with other applicable requirements 
outside the ITAR, such as National 
Security Agency certification 
requirements. 
One commenter objected to the ETL 
entry for USML Category XX(d), 
asserting it does not reflect U.S. legal 
obligations and that it will disrupt the 
development of AUKUS Pillar I and 
Pillar II activities. The Department 
declines to modify the USML Category 
XX(d) entry of the ETL at this time 
because the USG assesses that 
continued review of licenses or use of 
the § 126.4 exemption is required to 
protect critical technologies. The 
Department further notes that 
authorizations to export such 
technology are subject to the expedited 
licensing procedures referenced above. 
Authorized User-Related Public 
Comments 
A number of commenters offered 
observations and recommendations 
regarding the Authorized User Terms 
and Conditions. The Authorized User 
Terms and Conditions are the 
compliance requirements of Australian 
and UK parties participating in transfers 
or activities via the § 126.7 exemption. 
Australian and UK parties must sign the 
Authorized User Terms and Conditions 
to complete their Authorized User 
enrollment package and to initiate their 
governments’ review processes. The 
Authorized User Terms and Conditions 
were established as part of separate 
government-to-government agreements 
with Australia and the United Kingdom 
to provide maximum speed and 
accountability in enrolling and 
maintaining Authorized Users of 
Australia and the United Kingdom. 
While the administration of the 
Authorized User enrollment process is 
outside of the scope of this rulemaking, 
the Department summarizes and 
provides information in response to 
those comments here as a matter of 
convenience. 
Three commenters recommended 
modifying the Authorized Users Terms 
and Conditions to align the text with 
existing provisions of the ITAR, 
including § 127.12. The Department 
notes the Authorized User Terms and 
Conditions have been updated based on 
these recommendations to incorporate 
by reference existing disclosure 
guidance and requirements in §§ 127.12 
and 126.1. 
Three commenters recommended 
modifying the Authorized Users Terms 
and Conditions for the United Kingdom 
to use the existing § 123.9(b) destination 
control statement, and to amend 
§ 123.9(b)(1)(iv) to refer to a destination 
as ‘‘country or countries.’’ The 
Department notes the Authorized User 
Terms and Conditions have been 
updated to incorporate by reference the 
standard destination control statement 
in § 123.9(b). 
One commenter suggested UK 
industry is still unclear regarding the 
process of becoming an Authorized 
User, and the commenter stated that the 
UK Ministry of Defence assured them 
further guidance on the process is 
forthcoming. The commenter further 
expressed this has caused delays for 
industry. The Department notes the UK 
Ministry of Defence has provided 
further guidance regarding the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61059 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Authorized User enrollment process 
since the publication of the interim final 
rule that introduced the § 126.7 
exemption. 
One commenter reported problems 
with locating a list of U.S. Authorized 
Users and sought clarification as to 
whether that list is provided somewhere 
other than the Defense Export Control 
and Compliance System (DECCS). The 
Department notes, per the language of 
ITAR § 126.7(b)(2)(i), all U.S. persons 
registered with DDTC and who are 
eligible to receive an ITAR license or 
other authorization as stated in ITAR 
§ 120.16 may utilize the exemption 
provided all other criteria in § 126.7 are 
met. 
One commenter sought clarity 
regarding the process that should be 
followed to share technology with 
entities that are not Authorized Users 
within Australia, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States. The Department 
notes that while the § 126.7 exemption 
is not available in such cases, all other 
existing authorization mechanisms 
under the ITAR remain available, 
including the licensing process or other 
license exemptions within the ITAR, 
according to their terms. 
One commenter inquired as to 
whether the Authorized User process for 
the § 126.7 exemption included audits, 
certifications, or supply chain reviews. 
The Department notes that the 
Authorized User process is an 
intergovernmental process for vetting 
Authorized Users of the exemption 
within the UK and Australia. Additional 
information on becoming an Authorized 
User is available on the DDTC website 
and from the UK and Australian 
governments. 
One commenter noted that there will 
be a need to train companies who are 
Authorized Users not only on 
compliance with the § 126.7 exemption, 
but on their compliance obligations 
generally. The Department 
acknowledges the comment and 
continues to work with the governments 
of both the United Kingdom and 
Australia and industry in both countries 
to promote compliance. 
One commenter suggested that the 
Authorized User enrollment process is 
administratively burdensome, lengthy, 
and inconsistent among the three 
countries. The Department notes 
enrollment of Authorized Users is a 
priority across all three governments to 
support industry use of the § 126.7 
exemption and has already been 
modified and streamlined as described 
in this rule. 
One commenter stated that the 
respective Authorized User guidance 
documents for the United Kingdom and 
Australia have different notification 
requirements regarding changes to 
corporate information furnished to each 
respective government. Further, the 
commenter recommended that the UK 
reporting requirement to notify both the 
UK Ministry of Defense and DDTC of 
corporate information changes should 
be amended to conform to existing 
notification requirements pursuant to 
§ 127.12. The Department has recently 
updated the UK Authorized User Terms 
and Conditions accordingly. 
One commenter recommended that 
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States develop a process to 
report publicly when a former 
Authorized User is removed from the 
Authorized User list. The Department 
offers a reminder that the Authorized 
User list is the official up-to-date record 
of Authorized Users of Australia and the 
United Kingdom who are eligible via 
§ 126.7(b)(2)(iii). Non-governmental 
parties and state, territorial, or local 
government parties of Australia or the 
United Kingdom are required to be 
enumerated on the Authorized User list 
to be eligible via § 126.7(b)(2)(iii). 
Exemption users are responsible for 
checking if there are any changes to the 
list. 
One commenter recommended the 
Department enumerate UK and 
Australian government departments and 
agencies in § 126.7(b)(2), rather than on 
the Authorized User list, so that it is 
clear which entities are eligible to use 
the § 126.7 exemption. Similarly, 
another commenter recommended 
clarifying that government agencies that 
report to the Australian Department of 
Defence, the UK Ministry of Defence, 
and any other government departments 
are included as Authorized Users. The 
Department accepts this 
recommendation, in part, by adding 
regulatory text confirming that UK 
national-level and Australian federal 
government departments or agencies are 
within the scope of § 126.7(b)(2), but 
those departments or agencies are not 
enumerated on the Authorized User list, 
unless they so request. 
One commenter recommended 
moving away from manual reviews of 
the Authorized Users list in DECCS and 
providing an Application Programming 
Interface (API)—establishing a software 
communications protocol—between 
DECCS and industry screening tools to 
verify Authorized Users at the time of 
export. Alternatively, the commenter 
suggested the Department could also 
provide a downloadable Excel 
document with all Authorized Users. 
The Department acknowledges this 
comment and notes it is exploring 
upgrades to the Authorized User List in 
DECCS to increase functionality. 
Other Public Comments 
One commenter recommended the 
Department consider adding Canada, to 
include the Canadian exemptions found 
at § 126.5, into the new defense trade 
and cooperation framework for the 
United Kingdom and Australia. 
Alternatively, the commenter suggested 
retaining the Canadian exemptions at 
§ 126.5, but revising the language of 
those exemptions to mirror the language 
found in the § 126.7 exemption. The 
Department declines to accept both 
recommendations. The creation of the 
ITAR exemption for defense trade 
among the UK, Australia, and the 
United States came pursuant to section 
38(l) of the AECA; upon positive 
certification, the AECA called for the 
creation of an ITAR exemption with 
specific requirements. The Department 
continues to review options to improve 
standardization of exemption 
presentation throughout the regulations 
but also notes that the § 126.7 
exemption has requirements that differ 
from the Canadian exemptions and that 
are imposed by statute. 
One commenter sought clarity on 
nontransfer and use certificate (i.e., 
DSP–83) signature requirements when 
certain parties to a transaction are 
Authorized Users and others are not. 
The Department reiterates that 
§ 123.10(a) was amended to remove the 
requirement to sign a DSP–83 when 
relying on the exemptions in §§ 126.5 
and 126.7. With respect to § 126.5, the 
exemptions do not include any 
requirement that any party be an 
Authorized User and, pursuant to 
§ 123.10(a), the requirement to complete 
a DSP–83 is waived for transactions 
pursuant to that exemption regardless of 
any party’s status as an Authorized 
User. With respect to the § 126.7 
exemption, if any party to the 
transaction is not an Authorized User, 
the transaction would not qualify for the 
§ 126.7 exemption. In other words, the 
hypothetical scenario posed by the 
commenter is not possible because any 
transaction involving both Authorized 
Users and parties that are not 
Authorized Users would not be eligible 
for the § 126.7 exemption and would 
therefore need an alternative form of 
authorization, which would require the 
completion of a DSP–83 consistent with 
§ 123.10(a). 
One commenter recommended 
revising § 123.9(c)(4) to include the 
§ 126.7 exemption. The Department 
declines to accept this comment as 
§ 123.9(c)(4) outlines criteria specific to 
the UK and Australian Defense Trade

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61060 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations Cooperation Treaties exemptions found 
at §§ 126.16 and 126.17 and reexports or 
retransfers must likewise be authorized 
in accordance with the provisions of 
those Treaties. 
One commenter sought clarification 
on whether § 123.9(e) excludes § 126.7, 
similar to how it excludes §§ 126.16 and 
126.17. The Department confirms that 
defense articles exported pursuant to 
§ 126.7 are not excluded from § 123.9(e). 
One commenter suggested there is a 
need for Australia, the United Kingdom, 
and the United States to harmonize 
cyber security standards to effectively 
share defense-related technologies. The 
Department notes this comment is 
outside the scope of the rulemaking. 
One commenter expressed that 
industry is hoping for parallel changes 
to the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) 
process that are similar to the § 126.7 
exemption and that such changes are 
necessary for AUKUS to succeed. The 
Department acknowledges this 
comment; however, it is outside the 
scope of the rulemaking. 
One commenter recommended a 
Defense Trade Advisory Group made up 
of foreign industry, primarily from host 
countries that are U.S. allies, rather than 
just U.S. industry, to provide advice to 
the U.S. Government on regulatory 
issues. The Department acknowledges 
this comment; however, it is outside the 
scope of the rulemaking. 
One commenter recommended the 
Department clarify whether values for 
purposes of congressional certification 
are calculated on a ‘‘per shipment’’ 
includes ‘‘per transfers’’ of technical 
data and/or defense services. Further, 
the commenter requested the 
Department create an FAQ clarifying 
that congressional certification 
thresholds should not be based on the 
total contract value, including when a 
contract modification causes it to meet 
or exceed current congressional 
certification thresholds, but rather value 
for congressional certification purposes 
should be based on individual 
transactions that meet or exceed the 
congressional thresholds or those that 
involved the manufacturing of 
significant military equipment abroad. 
The Department notes the DDTC 
website has an existing FAQ on this 
topic, which states parties should base 
their calculations for congressional 
certification on a per shipment basis. 
One commenter recommended the 
Department work with its interagency 
partners and Congress to eliminate, 
within the context of the AUKUS 
partnership, the license requirement, 
interagency review, and tiered review of 
transfers that meet the congressional 
certification thresholds. The commenter 
went on to suggest that industry should 
only be required to submit notification 
of a transfer to the Department, who 
would then notify Congress using a 15- 
day review period. The Department will 
monitor the implementation and 
effectiveness of the § 126.7 exemption 
and make further amendments as 
appropriate, particularly after industry 
and government stakeholders are 
familiar with its application, but notes 
that the exemption articulates the scope 
of transfers the Department assesses are 
currently appropriate without the need 
for a license or congressional 
notification, as applicable. Sections 
36(c) and 36(d) of the AECA require the 
Department to notify Congress pursuant 
to the requirements articulated therein. 
One commenter encouraged 
continued Department engagement with 
industry through outreach events, 
communication via the DDTC website, 
and FAQs. The commenter noted that 
additional information on the 
Authorized User process, reporting 
requirements under § 126.7, reexports 
and retransfers, and expedited 
processing of license applications is 
welcomed. The Department appreciates 
this feedback and will continue to 
engage with industry to encourage use 
of the § 126.7 exemption. 
One commenter assessed that the 
§ 126.7 exemption will facilitate 
collaboration between the United States 
and Australia on space activities, but 
also expressed concern about potential 
industry confusion due to actual or 
perceived ‘‘crossover’’ between the 
§ 126.7 exemption and the recently- 
executed Technologies Safeguard 
Agreement (TSA) between the United 
States and Australia. The commenter 
did not suggest changes to regulatory 
language; rather, they requested the 
Department provide guidance to assist 
industry in navigating the requirements 
of the ITAR and the two governments’ 
TSA implementation and to consider 
how to reduce the administrative 
burden on exporters subject to both sets 
of requirements. The Department notes 
that TSAs are important pre-conditions 
that help ensure the necessary 
foundation is in place to adequately 
protect transfers of certain space launch 
vehicle assistance and technologies. In 
this respect, the responsibilities and 
obligations outlined in TSAs stem from 
and complement requirements in the 
ITAR. 
Regulatory Analysis and Notices 
Administrative Procedure Act 
This rulemaking is exempt from the 
notice-and-comment rulemaking and 
minimum effective date requirements of 
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1) as a 
military or foreign affairs function of the 
United States Government. For the 
reasons described in the interim final 
rule (89 FR 67270, as amended by 89 FR 
68778), the Department also believes 
that good cause exists to proceed with 
this rulemaking expeditiously as per 5 
U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3). 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Since this rule is exempt from the 
notice-and-comment provisions of 5 
U.S.C. 553 as a military or foreign affairs 
function, and based on the Department’s 
finding of good cause, the rule does not 
require analysis under the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
This rulemaking does not involve a 
mandate that will result in the 
expenditure by State, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million or more 
in any year and it will not significantly 
or uniquely affect small governments. 
Therefore, no actions are deemed 
necessary under the provisions of the 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995. 
Congressional Review Act 
The Department does not believe this 
rulemaking is a major rule within the 
definition of 5 U.S.C. 804(2). 
Executive Orders 12372 and 13132 
This rulemaking will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 13132, 
it is determined that this amendment 
does not have sufficient federalism 
implications to require consultations or 
warrant the preparation of a federalism 
summary impact statement. The 
regulations implementing Executive 
Order 12372 regarding 
intergovernmental consultation on 
Federal programs and activities do not 
apply to this rulemaking. 
Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
Executive Order 12866, as 
supplemented by Executive Order 
13563, directs agencies to assess all 
costs and benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61061 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations effects). Executive Order 13563 
emphasizes the importance of 
quantifying both costs and benefits, of 
reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, 
and of promoting flexibility. Because 
the scope of this rule does not impose 
additional regulatory requirements or 
obligations, the Department believes 
costs associated with this rule will be 
minimal. Regarding the exemption, 
Australia and the United Kingdom, as 
set forth in the section 655 reports 
required annually by the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, are 
ordinarily among the most commonly 
licensed destinations for transfers 
subject to the ITAR. The Department 
expects that far fewer licensing 
applications will be submitted for 
transfers of defense articles and defense 
services to and between Australia, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States 
as a result of the exemption. 
Consequently, this exemption will 
relieve licensing burdens for most 
exporters. Regarding when an ITAR 
exemption is not available for use, the 
expedited licensing process provides a 
substantial benefit to U.S. exporters for 
licensing applications involving 
Australia, the United Kingdom, or 
Canada. This rule is exempt from the 
requirements of Executive Order 14192 
because it relates to a foreign affairs 
function of the United States. This rule 
has been designated as a significant 
regulatory action by the Office and 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
under Executive Order 12866. 
Executive Order 12988 
The Department of State has reviewed 
this rulemaking in light of Executive 
Order 12988 to eliminate ambiguity, 
minimize litigation, establish clear legal 
standards, and reduce burden. 
Executive Order 13175 
The Department of State has 
determined that this rulemaking will 
not have tribal implications, will not 
impose substantial direct compliance 
costs on Indian tribal governments, and 
will not preempt tribal law. 
Accordingly, Executive Order 13175 
does not apply to this rulemaking. 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
This rulemaking does not impose or 
revise any information collections 
subject to 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

2. Revise and republish § 126.7 to read 
as follows: 
§ 126.7 Exemptions for defense trade and 
cooperation among Australia, the United 
Kingdom, and the United States 
(a) By U.S. persons, government departments or agencies, or Authorized 
Users. No license is required for the export, reexport, retransfer, or 
temporary import of defense articles, 
furnishing of defense services, or 
engaging in brokering activities as 
described in part 129 of this subchapter, 
between or among parties described in 
§ 126.7(b)(2), subject to the requirements 
and limitations in paragraph (b) of this 
section. 
(b) Requirements and limitations. The exemption described in paragraph (a) of 
this section is subject to the following 
requirements and limitations: 
(1) The activity must be to or within 
the physical territory of Australia, the 
United Kingdom, or the United States; 
(2) The transferor, recipient, or broker 
must each be: 
(i) A U.S. person registered with the 
applicable Directorate of Defense Trade 
Controls (DDTC) registration pursuant to 
§§ 122.1 and 129.3 of this subchapter, 
and eligible under § 120.16 of this 
subchapter; 
(ii) A U.S. Government department or 
agency, United Kingdom national-level 
government department or agency, or 
Australian federal government 
department or agency; or 
(iii) An Authorized User identified 
through the DDTC website and, if 
engaging in brokering activities, 
registered with DDTC pursuant to 
§ 129.3 of this subchapter; 
(3) The defense article or defense 
service is not identified in supplement 
no. 2 to this part as ineligible for 
transfer under the exemption in 
paragraph (a) of this section; 
(4) The value of the transfer does not 
exceed the amounts described in 
§ 123.15 of this subchapter and does not 
involve the manufacturing abroad of 
significant military equipment as 
described in § 124.11 of this subchapter; 
and 
(5) Transferors must comply with the 
requirements of § 123.9(b) of this 
subchapter. 
Note 1 to paragraph (b): The 
exemption in paragraph (a) of this 
section does not remove other 
applicable U.S. statutory and regulatory 
requirements. For example, for U.S. 
parties, transfers of classified defense 
articles and defense services must still 
meet the requirements in 32 CFR part 
117, National Industrial Security 
Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), 
in addition to all other applicable laws. 
Australian Authorized Users must, for 
example, meet the requirements in the 
Australian Protective Security Policy 
Framework, including appropriate 
security risk management for contracted 
providers. United Kingdom Authorized 
Users must, for example, meet the 
requirements in the Government 
Functional Standards GovS 007: 
Security. 
(c) Reexports, retransfers, or temporary imports in support of the 
armed forces of Australia, the United 
Kingdom, or the United States. No 
license is required for the reexport or 
retransfer of defense articles among 
parties described in § 126.7(b)(2) or 
temporary import of defense articles 
into the United States, subject to the 
requirements and limitations in 
paragraph (d) of this section. 
(d) Requirements and limitations. The exemption described in paragraph (c) of 
this section is subject to the following 
requirements and limitations: 
(1) The defense article was originally 
exported pursuant to a license or other 
approval; 
(2) To the extent that any party 
described in § 126.7(b)(2)(i) or (iii) is a 
party to the reexport, retransfer, or 
temporary import into the United States, 
such party is under contract with and 
either directly embedded with the 
armed forces of Australia, the United 
Kingdom, or the United States or 
operating alongside and in support of 
such forces; and 
(3) The purpose of the reexport, 
retransfer, or temporary import is for: 
(i) The provision of on-site support to 
the armed forces of Australia, the 
United Kingdom, or the United States, 
or 
(ii) The return to Australia or the 
United Kingdom, or the United States of 
defense articles used in on-site support 
of the armed forces of Australia, the 
United Kingdom or the United States; 
and 
(iii) The reexport, retransfer or 
temporary import is subject to

Housing Opportunity Through 
Modernization Act: Implementation of 
Sections 102 and 104; Further 
Extension of Compliance Date 
AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and 
Development, U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD). 
ACTION: Final rule; extension of compliance date. 
SUMMARY: This document further extends the compliance date for HUD’s 
final rule entitled Housing Opportunity 
Through Modernization Act of 2016: 
Implementation of Sections 102 and 104 
(HOTMA final rule) for Community 
Planning and Development (CPD) 
programs. Specifically, HUD is 
extending the compliance date for the 
HOME Investment Partnerships program 
(HOME), HOME-American Rescue Plan 
program, Housing Trust Fund (HTF), 
Housing Opportunities for Persons With 
AIDS (HOPWA), Community 
Development Block Grant program 
(CDBG), Emergency Solution Grants 
(ESG), Continuum of Care (CoC) 
programs, and CPD programs funded 
through competitive processes 
(Competitive Programs). This action is 
necessary to allow additional time for 
HUD to finalize necessary system 
updates and for CPD grantees to fully 
incorporate the new income and asset 
requirements into their programs. 
DATES: The compliance date for the final rule published February 14, 2023, at 88 
FR 9600, as previously extended, is 
further extended until January 1, 2027.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
On February 14, 2023, HUD published 
the HOTMA final rule (88 FR 9600), 
which established revisions to HUD’s 
income regulations at 24 CFR parts 5, 
92, 93, 570, and 574, affecting various 
CPD programs. The effective date for 
these revisions was January 1, 2024. 
Due to delays in the necessary 
updates to HUD’s internal systems and 
providing CPD grantees with sufficient 
time to incorporate the changes into 
their program policies, HUD previously 
published two extensions. The most 
recent extension, published on 
December 31, 2024 (89 FR 106998), 
extended the compliance date for CPD 
grantees to January 1, 2026. In addition, 
HUD permitted CPD grantees the 
flexibility to implement applicable 
HOTMA income safe harbors (e.g., 24 CFR 5.609(c)(3), 24 CFR 92.203(a) or 24 
CFR 93.151(a)) prior to full 
implementation deadline of the 
HOTMA final rule. 
On January 6, 2025, HUD published 
the final rule (FR–6144–F–03), titled 
‘‘HOME Investment Partnerships 
Program: Program Updates and 
Streamlining’’ (the 2025 HOME final 
rule). This rule extended the HOTMA 
compliance date for the HOME program 
until February 5, 2026, or later, as 
determined by HUD in 24 CFR 92.3. On 
February 3, 2025, HUD delayed the 
effective date of some elements of the 
HOME final rule, including changes to 
the income regulations at 24 CFR 
92.203, until April 20, 2025, and 
delayed the required compliance date of 
those provisions until April 20, 2026. 
The 2025 HOME final rule expanded 
the income safe harbors in 24 CFR 
92.203 to include additional forms of 
public assistance and expanded the 
entities from which PJs may accept 
income determinations for rental 
projects, including small scale projects 
and HOME funded tenant-based rental 
assistance programs. Additionally, it 
reduced the frequency of income 
determinations in TBRA programs. 
II. Further Extensions of the HOTMA 
Final Rule Compliance Date and 
Expanded Income Safe Harbors 
HUD has determined that a further 
extension of the HOTMA final rule is 
necessary. Despite the prior extension of 
the HOTMA final rule, additional time 
is required for HUD to complete the 
complex programming and testing of its 
systems that support CPD programs to 
ensure full compliance with all of the 
HOTMA final rule provisions. 
Furthermore, CPD grantees will require 
additional time after HUD’s system 
updates and final guidance are released 
to integrate these changes into their 
local program operations, update their 
own software, and train staff. 
Therefore, in recognition of these 
ongoing operational issues and the need 
for a smooth, effective transition, HUD 
is exercising its authority to further 
extend the compliance deadline for the 
HOTMA final rule. CPD grantees may 
continue to set their own compliance 
dates as early as January 1, 2024, but 
must be in full compliance no later than 
the date established by this document. 
As in the prior extension of the 
HOTMA final rule’s compliance date, 
HUD is permitting CPD grantees the 
choice to implement applicable income 
safe harbors in 24 CFR 5.609(c)(3). 
Additionally, HUD is permitting HOME 
PJs the choice to implement all 
expanded income safe harbors and 
flexibilities described in 24 CFR 92.203 
of the 2025 HOME final rule without 
implementing the remaining provisions 
of the regulations updated by the 
HOTMA final rule. 
Lastly, HUD reminds CPD grantees 
and project owners to comply with the 
most recent publication of the Federally 
Mandated Exclusions from Income (FR– 
6410–N–01), published on January 31, 
2024, when making income 
determinations, even if they have not 
yet implemented the HOTMA final rule.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES61063 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations III. Conclusion 
Accordingly, HUD extends the 
January 1, 2026, compliance date for 
implementing the changes made by the 
HOTMA final rule to 24 CFR parts 5, 92, 
93, 570, and 574 for the CPD programs 
described in this document until 
January 1, 2027. Until this date, CPD 
grantees may continue to adhere, as 
applicable, to the requirements found in 
both their program regulations and the 
regulations at 24 CFR 5.603, 24 CFR 
5.609, 24 CFR 5.611, and 24 CFR 5.617 
as they existed prior to January 1, 2024.

Coastal Migratory Pelagic Resources 
of the Gulf of America and Atlantic 
Region; 2025–2026 Commercial 
Accountability Measure for the King 
Mackerel Run-Around Gillnet Fishery 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; commercial accountability measure. 
SUMMARY: NMFS implements an accountability measure (AM) for king 
mackerel using run-around gillnet gear 
in the southern zone of the Gulf of 
America (Gulf) exclusive economic zone 
(EEZ) for the 2025–2026 fishing year. 
NMFS has determined that commercial 
landings of king mackerel harvested by 
run-around gillnet gear in the Gulf 
southern zone in the 2024–2025 fishing 
year have exceeded the component’s 
annual catch limit (ACL). Therefore, 
NMFS implements the AM to reduce the 
commercial gillnet component ACL for 
king mackerel in the Gulf southern zone 
for the 2025–2026 fishing year. 
DATES: This rule is effective December 30, 2025, through June 30, 2026. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Kelli O’Donnell, NMFS Southeast 
Regional Office, telephone: 727–824– 
5305, email: kelli.odonnell@noaa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish 
in the Gulf includes king mackerel, 
Spanish mackerel, and cobia, and is 
managed under the Fishery 
Management Plan for the Coastal 
Migratory Pelagic Resources of the Gulf 
and Atlantic Region (FMP). The FMP 
was prepared by the Gulf and South 
Atlantic Fishery Management Councils 
and NMFS, approved by the Secretary of 
Commerce, and is implemented by 
NMFS under the authority of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act) by regulations 
at 50 CFR part 622. All weights for the 
Gulf migratory group of king mackerel 
(Gulf king mackerel) apply as either 
round or gutted weight. 
The commercial fishery for Gulf king 
mackerel is divided into western, 
northern, and southern zones. The 
southern zone for Gulf king mackerel 
encompasses an area of the Gulf EEZ off 
Collier and Monroe Counties in south 
Florida, south of a line extending due 
west from the boundary of Lee and 
Collier Counties on the Florida west 
coast, and south of a line extending due 
east from the boundary of Monroe and 
Miami-Dade Counties on the Florida 
east coast (50 CFR 622.369(a)(1)(iii)). 
For an illustration of the king mackerel 
zones, see Figure 1 in Appendix G to 
part 622 at https://www.ecfr.gov/ 
current/title-50/chapter-VI/part-622/ 
appendix-Appendix%20G%20to%20
Part%20622. 
The commercial ACL for Gulf king 
mackerel is divided into separate ACLs 
for hook-and-line and run-around 
gillnet gear. The use of run-around 
gillnets for king mackerel is restricted to 
the Gulf southern zone. For the 2024– 
2025 fishing year, the king mackerel 
commercial gillnet quota (equivalent to 
the commercial gillnet ACL) is 671,328 
pounds (lb) (304,509 kilograms (kg)) (50 
CFR 622.384(b)(1)(iii)(B)). The fishing 
year for Gulf king mackerel in the 
southern zone is from July 1 through 
June 30 (50 CFR 622.7(b)(1)(i)) but the 
gillnet component has a seasonal 
closure from July 1 until 6 a.m. eastern 
time on the day after the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Federal holiday (50 CFR 
622.378(a)). 
Regulations at 50 CFR 
622.388(a)(1)(iii) state that if 
commercial landings of Gulf king 
mackerel caught by run-around gillnet 
gear in the southern zone exceed the 
commercial gillnet component ACL, 
then in the following fishing year, 
NMFS will reduce the commercial 
gillnet component ACL by the amount 
of the commercial gillnet component 
ACL overage in the prior fishing year. 
NMFS’ most recent commercial 
landings data for the 2024–2025 fishing 
year indicate that the commercial gillnet 
component exceeded its ACL of 671,328 
lb (304,509 kg) by 1,188 lb (539 kg) for 
the fishing year that ended on June 30, 
2025. Accordingly, for the 2025–2026 
fishing year and consistent with the 
commercial AM, NMFS reduces the 
commercial gillnet component ACL for 
the Gulf southern zone to 670,140 lb 
(303,970 kg). 
The fishing season for Gulf king 
mackerel using run-around gillnet gear 
in the southern zone is currently closed 
and will open again at 6 a.m., local time, 
on January 20, 2026 (50 CFR 
622.378(a)).

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment is 
unnecessary and contrary to the public 
interest. Such procedure is unnecessary 
because the regulations associated with 
the commercial AM and commercial 
ACL for Gulf king mackerel have 
already been subject to notice and 
public comment, and all that remains is 
to notify the public of the adjusted 
commercial ACL for the 2025–2026 
fishing year. Prior notice and 
opportunity for public comment are 
contrary to the public interest because 
of the need to notify the industry in 
advance of the next commercial fishing 
season. 
For the reasons just stated, there is 
good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to 
waive the 30-day delay in effectiveness 
of this action.

ACTION: Temporary rule; quota transfer. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that the State of North Carolina is transferring a 
portion of its 2025 commercial summer 
flounder quota to the State of New 
Jersey. This adjustment to the 2025 
fishing year quota is necessary to 
comply with the Summer Flounder, 
Scup, and Black Sea Bass Fishery 
Management Plan (FMP) quota transfer 
provisions. This announcement informs 
the public of the revised 2025 
commercial quotas for North Carolina 
and New Jersey. 
DATES: Effective December 29, 2025, through December 31, 2025. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Matthew Rigdon, Fishery Management 
Specialist, (978) 281–9336. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Regulations governing the summer 
flounder fishery are found in 50 CFR 
648.100 through 648.111. These 
regulations require annual specification 
of a commercial quota that is 
apportioned among the coastal states 
from Maine through North Carolina. The 
process to set the annual commercial 
quota and the percent allocated to each 
state is described in § 648.102, and the 
final 2025 allocations were published 
on December 10, 2024 (89 FR 99138). 
The final rule implementing 
amendment 5 to the FMP, as published 
in the Federal Register on December 17, 
1993 (58 FR 65936), provided a 
mechanism for transferring summer 
flounder commercial quota from one 
state to another. Two or more states, 
under mutual agreement and with the 
concurrence of the NMFS Greater 
Atlantic Regional Administrator, can 
transfer or combine summer flounder 
commercial quota under § 648.102(c)(2). 
The Regional Administrator is required 
to consider three criteria in the 
evaluation of requests for quota transfers 
or combinations: (1) the transfers or 
combinations would not preclude the 
overall annual quota from being fully 
harvested; (2) the transfers address an 
unforeseen variation or contingency in 
the fishery; and (3) the transfers are 
consistent with the objectives of the 
FMP and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act). The Regional 
Administrator has determined these 
three criteria have been met for the 
transfer approved in this notification. 
North Carolina is transferring 125,000 
pounds (lb; 56,699 kilograms (kg)) of 
summer flounder to New Jersey through 
a mutual agreement between the states. 
This transfer was requested to ensure 
that New Jersey would not exceed its 
2025 state quota. The revised summer 
flounder quotas for 2025 are: North 
Carolina, 2,107,603 lb (955,993 kg); and 
New Jersey, 1,595,098 lb (723,524 kg).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Regulations governing the Atlantic 
bluefish fishery are found in 50 CFR 
648.160 through 648.167. These 
regulations require annual specification 
of a commercial quota that is 
apportioned among the coastal states 
from Maine through Florida. The 
process to set the annual commercial 
quota and the percent allocated to each 
state is described in § 648.162, and the 
final 2025 allocations were published 
on December 10, 2024 (89 FR 99138). 
The final rule implementing 
amendment 1 to the FMP, as published 
in the Federal Register on July 26, 2000

more states, under mutual agreement 
and with the concurrence of the NMFS 
Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator, 
can request approval to transfer or 
combine bluefish commercial quota 
under § 648.162(e). The Regional 
Administrator is required to consider 
three criteria in the evaluation of 
requests for quota transfers or 
combinations: (1) the transfers would 
not preclude the overall annual quota 
from being fully harvested; (2) the 
transfers address an unforeseen 
variation or contingency in the fishery; 
and (3) the transfers are consistent with 
the objectives of the FMP and the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act). The Regional 
Administrator has determined these 
criteria have been met for the transfers 
approved in this notification. 
New Jersey is transferring 50,000 
pounds (lb) (22,680 kilograms (kg)) of 
Atlantic bluefish to North Carolina 
through mutual agreement of the states. 
This transfer was requested to ensure 
North Carolina would not exceed its 
2025 state quota. The revised bluefish 
quotas for 2025 are: New Jersey, 182,630 
lb (82,840 kg); and North Carolina, 
1,472,012 lb (667,693 kg).

Pacific Cod in the Bering Sea and 
Aleutian Islands Management Area 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Temporary rule; reallocation. SUMMARY: NMFS is reallocating the projected unused amount of Pacific cod 
total allowable catch (TAC) from vessels 
using jig gear, to catcher vessels less 
than 60 feet (18.3 meters (m)) length 
overall (LOA) using hook-and-line or 
pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian 
Islands (BSAI) management area. This 
action is necessary to allow the A 
season allowance of the 2026 TAC of 
Pacific cod to be harvested.

(A.l.t.), December 31, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the 
BSAI according to the Fishery 
Management Plan for Groundfish of the 
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands 
Management Area (FMP) prepared and 
recommended by the North Pacific 
Fishery Management Council under 
authority of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management 
Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). 
Regulations governing fishing by U.S. 
vessels in accordance with the FMP 
appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 
and 50 CFR part 679. 
The A season allowance of the 2026 
Pacific cod TAC specified for vessels 
using jig gear in the BSAI is 990 metric 
tons (mt) as established by the final 
2025 and 2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI (90 FR 12640, 
March 18, 2025) and inseason 
adjustment (90 FR 60025, December 23, 
2025). 
The 2026 Pacific cod TAC allocated to 
catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 m) 
LOA using hook-and-line or pot gear in 
the BSAI is 2,342 mt as established by 
the final 2025 and 2026 harvest 
specifications for groundfish in the 
BSAI (90 FR 12640, March 18, 2025) 
and inseason adjustment (90 FR 60025, 
December 23, 2025). 
The Administrator, Alaska Region, 
NMFS (the Administrator) has 
determined that jig vessels will not be 
able to harvest 930 mt of the A season 
allowance of the 2026 Pacific cod TAC 
allocated to those vessels under 
§ 679.20(a)(7)(ii)(A)(1). The 
Administrator has also determined that 
catcher vessels less than 60 feet (18.3 m) 
LOA using hook-and-line or pot gear 
have the capability to harvest additional 
Pacific cod TAC. 
Therefore, in accordance with 
§ 679.20(a)(7)(iv)(C), NMFS reallocates 
930 mt of Pacific cod from the A season 
jig gear allowance to the annual amount 
specified for catcher vessels less than 60 
feet (18.3 m) LOA using hook-and-line 
or pot gear. 
The harvest specifications for 2026 
Pacific cod included in final 2025 and 
2026 harvest specifications for 
groundfish in the BSAI (90 FR 12640, 
March 18, 2025) and inseason 
adjustment (90 FR 60025, December 23, 
2025) are revised as follows: 60 mt to 
the A season allowance and 721 mt to 
the annual amount for vessels using jig 
gear, and 3,272 mt to catcher vessels 
less than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA using 
hook-and-line or pot gear. 
Classification 
NMFS issues this action pursuant to 
section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act. This action is required by 50 CFR 
part 679, which was issued pursuant to 
section 304(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, and is exempt from review under 
Executive Order 12866. 
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), there 
is good cause to waive prior notice and 
an opportunity for public comment on 
this action, as notice and comment 
would be impracticable and contrary to 
the public interest, as it would prevent 
NMFS from responding to the most 
recent fisheries data in a timely fashion 
and would not allow for the full harvest 
of the Pacific cod TACs by the sectors 
with harvesting capability. NMFS was 
unable to publish a notice providing 
time for public comment because the 
most recent, relevant data on the harvest 
of Pacific cod by sectors operating in the 
BSAI and the capability of certain 
sectors to harvest additional TAC only 
became available as of December 22, 
2025. 
There is also good cause under 5 
U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make this action 
effective immediately upon filing with 
the Office of the Federal Register. This 
finding is based upon the reasons 
provided above for waiver of prior

Streamlining Probationary and Trial 
Period Appeals 
AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. 
ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing a rule 
to change the circumstances and 
procedures for adjudicating appeals 
from employees covered by these 
provisions and terminated during their 
probationary or trial periods and 
supervisors and managers who fail to 
complete their probationary periods. 
This change follows the President’s 
rescinding of the regulations at subpart 
H of part 315 of this chapter as directed 
by Executive Order 14284. As proposed, 
employees would file appeals limited 
to: discrimination based on partisan 
political reasons or marital status; and 
failure to follow procedures for 
terminations based upon pre- 
appointment reasons. OPM would 
replace the Merit Systems Protection 
Board (MSPB) as the adjudicative 
agency for all appeals. Employees who 
wish to pursue claims of discrimination 
under statutes administered by the 
Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC) would not be 
allowed to raise these claims with OPM. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 29, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by the docket number or 
Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) for 
this proposed rulemaking, by the 
following method: 
Federal eRulemaking Portal: https://
www.regulations.gov. Follow the instructions for sending comments. 
All submissions must include the 
agency name and docket number or RIN 
for this rulemaking. Please arrange and 
identify your comments on the 
regulatory text by subpart and section 
number; if your comments relate to the 
supplementary information, please refer 
to the heading and page number. All 
comments received will be posted 
without change, including any personal 
information provided. To ensure that 
your comments will be considered, you 
must submit them within the specified 
open comment period. Before finalizing 
this rule, OPM will consider all 
comments within the scope of the 
regulations received on or before the 
closing date for comments. OPM may 
make changes to the final rule after 
considering the comments received. 
As required by 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(4), a 
summary of this rule may be found in 
the docket for this rulemaking at 
www.regulations.gov. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Carol Matheis by email at 
employeeaccountability@opm.gov or by phone at (202) 606–2930. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OPM proposes this rule to establish 
streamlined appeal procedures for 
employees terminated during their 
probationary or trial periods and 
supervisors and managers who fail to 
complete their probationary periods. 
Under Executive Order (E.O.) 14284, the 
President rendered the probationary 
period appeal procedures in subpart H 
of part 315 of this chapter ‘‘inoperative 
and without effect’’ and directed OPM 
to rescind those regulations and make 
conforming amendments. OPM 
published a final rule implementing 
those directives on June 24, 2025, at 90 
FR 26727. E.O. 14284 delegated 
authority to OPM to establish such 
procedures by regulation. The proposed 
rule removes authority from the MSPB 
for actions under subpart I of part 315 
of this chapter and grants authority to 
OPM to adjudicate appeals. The 
proposal would grant authority to OPM 
to adjudicate appeals by employees 
terminated during their probationary or 
trial periods and by supervisors and 
managers who fail to complete their 
probationary periods (akin to the former 
§ 315.806 and the current § 315.908, 
respectively). OPM will only adjudicate 
appeals that allege either discrimination 
based on partisan political reasons or 
marital status; or an agency’s failure to 
follow procedures for terminations 
based upon pre-appointment reasons. 
Employees will not, however, be able to 
attach claims of unlawful 
discrimination under the laws 
administered by the EEOC to an appeal 
as previously permitted before issuance 
of E.O. 14284. Employees may pursue 
such claims at the EEOC to the same 
extent they could do so before issuance 
of E.O. 14284. 
Additionally, when OPM adjudicates 
an appeal, it will do so based on the 
written record without the need of 
extensive discovery. However, where 
OPM determines additional information 
is necessary, it may conduct an 
investigation or audit into an agency’s 
termination action. An appellant will 
not have a right to a hearing, but OPM 
may conduct one only when necessary 
and where it will aid in the efficient 
resolution of an appeal. Lastly, the 
proposed rule provides a procedure for 
an appellant to seek reconsideration of 
the decision. 
I. Background 
a. History of Probationary Periods in the 
Federal Service 
Since the dawn of the modern civil 
service, it has been widely recognized— 
by courts, by OPM, and by OPM’s 
predecessor agency, the Civil Service 
Commission—that Federal employees 
serving a probationary or trial period 
had far more limited procedural rights 
regarding their terminations than other 
Federal employees. 
‘‘Probation’’ comes from the Latin 
‘‘probatio,’’
1
which means ‘‘trying, 
proving’’ or ‘‘a trial, inspection, [or] 
examination.’’
2
Ballentine’s Law 
Dictionary defines ‘‘probationary status’’ 
in relevant part as ‘‘[a] person having a 
period of probation in a civil service 
position by way of a further test of his 
qualifications for appointment.’’

30112109910338&seq=237&q1. 
The concept of a probationary, or 
trial, period in the U.S. civil service 
dates to the Pendleton Civil Service Act 
of 1883 (Pendleton Act). The Pendleton 
Act required ‘‘that there shall be a 
period of probation before any absolute 
appointment or employment 
aforesaid.’’
4
The new Civil Service 
Commission created by the Pendleton 
Act reflected a similar understanding of 
probation. In its first annual report in 
1884, the Commission characterized the 
probationary period as lasting ‘‘six 
months before any absolute 
appointment can be made. At the end of 
this time the appointee goes out of the 
service unless then reappointed.’’
5
Two 
years later, the Commission wrote in its 
third annual report that ‘‘doing the 
public work is precisely what the Merit 
System provides. If at its termination 
the appointing officer is not . . . willing 
to make an unconditional appointment, 
the probationer is . . . absolutely out of 
the service without any action on the 
part of the Government.
6
In 1897 
President William McKinley signed E.O. 
101, Amending Civil Service Rules 
Regarding Removal from Service, 
adding a number 8 to Rule II that stated: 
‘‘No removal shall be made from any 
position subject to competitive 
examination except for just cause and 
upon written charges filed with the 
head of the Department, or other 
appointing officer, and of which the 
accused shall have full notice and an 
opportunity to make defense.’’ 
In 1910, the Court of Claims 
explained in the case of Ruggles v. United States that probationers lacked 
any cognizable legal rights under the 
rules or the Pendleton Act.
7
 
With the enactment of the Lloyd- 
Lafollette Act of 1912, Congress created 
the first legislative codification of 
protection against removal for civil 
servants. The Act established ‘‘[t]hat no 
person in the classified civil service of 
the United States shall be removed 
therefrom except for such cause as will 
promote the efficiency of said service.’’
8
 
The Act also imposed certain 
procedural requirements on removals 
including advance notice and an 
opportunity to respond in writing.
9
 
However, Congress did not establish 
employment protections for 
probationary employees. 
After the passage of the Lloyd-La 
Follette Act and the court’s decision in 
Ruggles, the Civil Service Commission took the opportunity to clarify that the 
removal rules first established in 1897 
should never have been treated as 
creating any serious limits on removing 
civil servants from employment.
10
 
Regarding probationers, the Commission 
quoted from Ruggles that probationers have no cognizable right to their 
employment
11
and that the Lloyd-La 
Follette Act’s protections did not apply 
to probationers at all.
12
Over the next 
decade, the Commission would 
repeatedly cite the Ruggles decision and its assessment of the Lloyd-La Follette 
Act.
13
The Court of Claims also repeated 
its assessment that the Lloyd-La Follette 
Act did not convey any right for a 
probationary employee over his or her 
position 45 years after its decision in 
Ruggles.
14
 
By 1922, the Commission expressed 
concerns that too few probationers were 
being terminated and that agencies were 
not adequately using the probationary 
period as a screening mechanism.
15
 
Consistent with that concern, over the 
next couple of decades, the Commission 
maintained the view, embodied in its 
regulations, that probationers retained 
virtually no protection from removal at 
all. For example, in its 1938 regulations, 
the Commission described the removal 
procedures for probationers as follows: 
‘‘Probationer; charges not necessary. A 
probationer may be separated from the 
service at any time during or at the 
expiration of the probationary period 
without further formality than a written 
notification setting forth the reasons in 
full.’’
16
The Commission would also 
repeat its complaint about agencies’ 
inadequate use of the probationary 
period to screen out probationers 
several times, including in 1929, 1934, 
1948, and 1949.
17
 
The Veterans Preference Act of 1944 
expanded civil service protections 
beyond the Lloyd-La Follette Act to 
preference eligible Federal employees, 
but it explicitly excluded 
probationers.
18
President John F. 
Kennedy later expanded these 
protections beyond preference eligibles. 
As the Civil Service Commission 
recognized, ‘‘[w]ith the issuance of 
Executive Orders 10987 and 10988 on 
January 17, 1962, a new era of greatly 
expanded appeals rights for employees 
was opened.’’
19
However, nothing in 
these E.O.s or implementation by the 
Civil Service Commission attempted to 
expand application of those protections 
to probationers. 
For a brief period of time starting in

rights to probationary employees.
20
But 
in 1962, the Commission revoked these 
regulations.
21
In the following year, the 
Commission issued new regulations 
establishing much more limited appeal 
rights for probationary employees that, 
until E.O. 14284, permitted appeals 
based on improper discrimination or 
terminations for matters arising before 
employment.
22
 
The passage of the Civil Service 
Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) formed the 
basis of the current law governing 
probationary employment. The relevant 
language, unchanged since 1978, 
provides the President with substantial 
authority to issue regulations inter alia 
establishing the conditions in which an 
appointment in the competitive service 
becomes final.
23
The Senate Committee 
for Government Affairs explained in its 
report on the CSRA the importance of 
preserving executive discretion to 
remove probationers as ‘‘an extension of 
the examining process to determine an 
employee’s ability to actually perform 
the duties of the position. It is 
inappropriate to restrict an agency’s 
authority to separate an employee who 
does not perform acceptably during this 
period.’’
24
Courts seized on this 
language in interpreting the rights of 
probationary employees.
25
As the 
United States Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia explained in Dep’t 
of Justice v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, Congress chose not to extend the same employment protections 
afforded tenured employees to 
probationary employees because it 
‘‘recognized and approved of the 
inextricable link between the effective 
operation of the probationary period 
and the agency’s right to summary 
termination.’’
26
Similarly, courts 
elsewhere recognized Congress’ 
intentional limitation on protections for 
probationary employees.
27
Further, 
because Congress did not provide the 
same employment protections to 
probationary employees, probationers 
do not have a property interest in their 
employment and therefore have no 
constitutional right to due process.
28
 
In addition, the CSRA gives OPM 
extensive discretion in regulating 
probationary periods. Pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. 1301, ‘‘The Office of Personnel 
Management shall aid the President, as 
he may request, in preparing the rules 
he prescribes under this title for the 
administration of the competitive 
service.’’ Under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(1): ‘‘the 
President may delegate, in whole or in 
part, authority for personnel 
management functions, including 
authority for competitive examinations, 
to the Director of the Office of Personnel 
Management.’’ Further, OPM ‘‘shall 
establish standards which shall apply to 
the activities of the Office or any other 
agency under authority delegated under 
subsection (a) of this section.’’
29
And 
the OPM Director has the responsibility 
‘‘to prescribe regulations and to ensure 
compliance with the civil service laws, 
rules, and regulations,’’ and ‘‘execut[e], 
administer[ ], and enforc[e] . . . the civil 
service rules and regulations of the 
President and the Office and the laws 
governing the civil service.’’
30
 
As a general matter, ‘‘Congress wrote 
the statute it wrote,’’ and ‘‘[t]hat 
congressional election settles’’ questions 
of interpretation. See CSX Transp., Inc. 
v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, 296 (2011). In this light, the best 
reading of the statute’s absence of an 
explicit directive is that Congress 
intended for the President, through 
OPM, to retain maximum flexibility to 
determine the procedures under which 
a probationer may be removed, 
including which entity is best 
positioned to serve as the venue for 
appeals of such a removal. Absent 
Presidential or Congressional action, the 
authority to grant employees serving a 
probationary period employment 
protections resides with OPM. Courts 
have recognized that Congress charged 
OPM with the authority to establish 
conditions of employment including 
procedural protections.
31
This includes 
rights to challenge removals in violation 
of these protections.
32
 
b. Executive Order 14284 
Concerns that agencies have not been 
effectively utilizing probationary 
periods have continued into the 21st 
century. In 2005, the MSPB reported to 
the President and to Congress that 
Federal agencies were failing to use the 
probationary period to assess and 
remove probationers.
33
In conducting a 
survey of agency supervisors, the MSPB 
found that, even though supervisors are 
aware that the probationer’s 
appointment is not final, supervisors 
tend to treat their probationers as fully 
appointed Federal employees, with all 
the rights and responsibilities that 
implies.’’ The MSPB identified that the 
failure of the Federal Government to 
maximize the probationary period is a 
cultural problem pervasive across all 
levels. The problem appeared to be a 
systemic one, as ‘‘supervisors expressed 
frustration at the lack of agency support 
for the full use of the probationary 
period, and even a number of 
probationers were perturbed by what 
they saw as agencies’ failure to use the 
probationary period to remove marginal 
and poor performers.’’ The MSPB 
reaffirmed the 2005 report in a 2019 
Research Brief, acknowledging that 
‘‘MSPB found that supervisors are 
sometimes reluctant to remove a 
probationer who is not performing well 
in the position, even though it is easier 
to remove a probationer than an 
employee with a final appointment.’’
34
 
In 2015, the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) issued a 
report regarding Federal workforce 
performance.
35
GAO interviewed a 
number of chief human capital officers 
in Federal agencies and found that 
‘‘[a]gencies may not be using the 
supervisory probationary period as 
intended.’’ The GAO found that 
‘‘supervisors are often not making 
performance-related decisions about an

individual’s future likelihood of success 
with the agency during the probationary 
period.’’ This typically happened for 
two reasons: ‘‘(1) the supervisor may not 
know that the individual’s probationary 
period is ending, and (2) the supervisor 
has not had enough time to observe the 
individual’s performance in all critical 
areas of the job.’’ The GAO concluded 
that the probationary period needed to 
be ‘‘more effectively used by 
agencies.... [I]mproving how the probationary period is used could help 
agencies more effectively deal with poor 
performers.’’ 
To this day, poor performance in the 
civil service has not been adequately 
addressed. OPM’s 2024 Federal 
Employee Viewpoint Survey indicated 
that 40 percent of Federal employees 
reported that poor performers in their 
units would usually ‘‘[r]emain in the 
work unit and continue to 
underperform[.]’’
36
The next highest 
percentage of respondents—21 
percent—answered ‘‘Do Not Know[.]’’ 
Only 47 percent agreed that ‘‘[i]n my 
work unit, differences in performance 
are recognized in a meaningful way.’’ 27 
percent disagreed with that claim. 
President Trump sought to address 
this longstanding issue when he signed 
E.O. 14284, ‘‘Strengthening 
Probationary Periods in the Federal 
Service,’’ on April 24, 2025.
37
E.O. 
14284 established Civil Service Rule XI 
to govern Federal agencies’ use of 
probationary and trial periods. Under 
Civil Service Rule XI, agencies must 
assess and certify their employees 
serving probationary or trial periods 
before finalizing their appointments to 
the Federal service. Civil Service Rule 
XI provides four non-mandatory criteria 
for the agency head, or designee, to 
consider in determining whether a 
probationary employee’s continued 
employment advances the public’s 
interest. Where an agency determines 
not to certify an employee’s continued 
employment, the employee’s 
appointment expires before the end of 
the employee’s tour of duty on the last 
day of their probationary or trial period. 
The agency also retains the discretion to 
dismiss them prior to the expiration of 
their probationary or trial period. 
Section 4 of E.O. 14284 also revoked 
the termination and appeal procedures 
under subpart H of part 315 of this 
chapter. These procedures, which 
applied upon initial appointment to a 
career career-conditional competitive 
service position, included the 
requirement for agencies to provide, at 
a minimum, written notice of the 
agency’s conclusions as to the 
inadequacies of an employee’s 
performance or conduct when 
terminating an employee during a 
probationary period; procedures and 
bases for appealing a termination during 
a probationary period; and the authority 
of the MSPB to adjudicate appeals. 
Under Civil Service Rule 11.6 (5 CFR 
11.6), the President delegated authority 
to the Director of OPM to issue 
rulemaking on the circumstances and 
procedures for employees to appeal 
their termination from a probationary or 
trial period. 
Prior to E.O. 14284, OPM established 
through regulation the circumstances 
and procedures for appealing 
terminations during an employee’s 
probationary period. Congress defined 
the term ‘‘employee’’ for purposes of 
identifying who could appeal certain 
adverse actions to the MSPB to exclude 
employees serving a probationary or 
trial period.
38
However, Congress also 
granted, inadvertently or not,
39
appeal 
rights to employees in the (1) 
competitive service who complete one 
year of current continuous service under 
other than a temporary appointment 
limited to one year or less; (2) excepted 
service who are preference eligibles that 
completed one year of current 
continuous service in the same or 
similar positions in either an Executive 
Agency or the United States Postal 
Service or Postal Rate Commission; or 
(3) excepted service who complete two 
years of current continuous service in 
the same or similar positions in an 
Executive agency under other than a 
temporary appointment as defined by 
OPM regulations in 5 CFR 
213.104(a)(1).
40
For employees who did 
not meet the definition of employee, 
they could not appeal, for example, a 
termination from the Federal service. 
However, the Civil Service Commission 
and, later, OPM exercised its authority 
to prescribe the circumstances in which 
an employee serving a probationary 
period in the competitive service could 
appeal to the Civil Service Commission 
or MSPB, respectively.
41
 
Likewise, Congress did not establish 
through statute the circumstances under 
which supervisors and managers failing 
their probationary period have the right 
to appeal their assignment to 
nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial 
positions.
42
Nor did Congress specify 
that the MSPB adjudicate such appeals. 
However, OPM exercised its regulatory 
authority to authorize the MSPB to 
adjudicate such appeals that raise 
discrimination based on partisan 
political reasons or marital status.
43
 
OPM proposes to establish limited 
grounds for employees serving a 
probationary period in the competitive 
service to appeal their terminations. 
Under these proposed regulations, such 
employees will be able to challenge 
their terminations for alleged 
discrimination based on partisan 
political reasons or marital status. These 
limited grounds of appeal for 
probationary terminations reflect the 
historical principle that probationary 
periods serve as a critical evaluation 
phase for new Federal employees, and 
thus that agencies should enjoy great 
flexibility in separating employees 
serving probationary or trial periods. 
Some non-veteran excepted service 
employees may qualify for appeal rights 
under other regulatory or legal 
provisions not covered by this rule. It 
should also be noted that excepted 
service employees serving in an 
appointment in the excepted service 
outside of part 307 of this chapter did 
not have such appeal rights unless 
otherwise entitled by statute, and OPM 
is maintaining that policy. Providing 
limited grounds of appeal also ensures 
agencies adhere to the Merit System 
Principles and corrects agency actions 
taken contrary to these principles 
consistent with OPM’s statutory 
authority.
44
Notably, in Civil Service 
Rule XI, the President designated OPM 
as the body which defines the 
‘‘circumstances under and procedures 
by which employees terminated from a 
probationary or trial period may appeal 
such termination.
45
Further, ‘‘[e]xcept 
as otherwise required by law, such 
appeals shall be the sole and exclusive 
means of appealing terminations during 
probationary or trial periods.

adding part 751 as explained below to 
promote accountability and improve the 
efficient adjudication of employee 
appeals. 
OPM proposes to revise paragraph (f) 
of § 230.402 to identify the proposed 
part 751 regulations as the applicable 
appeal procedures for employees 
serving an emergency-indefinite 
appointment in a national emergency. 
The current references to §§ 315.804 and 
315.805 are no longer valid after those 
sections were removed pursuant to E.O. 
14284.
47
The revisions also clarify that 
the first year of service for employees 
serving an emergency-indefinite 
appointment in a national emergency is 
a probationary period, not a trial period 
as the regulation currently states. 
OPM proposes to update an invalid 
reference to subpart H of part 351 
(which has been removed) in 
§ 315.201(ato refer, instead, to 5 CFR 
part 11. OPM also proposes to revise 
paragraph (b) of § 315.908 such that 
OPM will adjudicate appeals by 
supervisors or managers assigned to 
nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial 
positions for failing a probationary 
period under subpart I of part 315. 
OPM proposes to establish a new part 
751 to incorporate many of the 
provisions rescinded by E.O. 14284. The 
proposed § 751.101(a) establishes a right 
to appeal to OPM for employees, as 
specifically defined at § 751.101(f), 
terminated during the probationary or 
trial period required under Civil Service 
Rule XI, or who are assigned to a 
nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial 
position for failure to complete a 
supervisory or managerial probationary 
period required under subpart I of part 
315 of this chapter. 
OPM believes that tasking its Merit 
System Accountability and Compliance 
(MSAC) office with adjudication of 
probationer appeals will provide much 
needed clarity and efficiency. MSAC is 
not only equipped, but best positioned, 
to handle this task. MSAC is an 
external-facing organization within 
OPM with longstanding oversight and 
adjudicative functions. As part of those 
functions, MSAC provides employees 
with administrative procedural rights to 
challenge agency determinations 
without having to seek redress in 
Federal court. Distinct from MSPB, it 
has the infrastructure in place to 
adjudicate probationer appeals 
effectively without being subject to 
restrictions arising from the lack of a 
quorum. Specifically, ‘‘MSAC is 
responsible for ensuring that Federal 
agency human resources programs are 
effective and efficient and comply with 
merit system principles and related civil 
service regulations,’’
48
which includes 
oversight of agency personnel actions. 
MSAC also has ‘‘a long history of 
adjudicating federal employee 
classification appeals, as well as Fair 
Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 
compensation and leave, and 
declination of reasonable offer 
claims.’’
49
MSAC ‘‘offer[s] federal 
employees an independent review of 
agency personnel decisions. OPM’s 
decision in these cases is the final 
administrative decision.’’
50
 
Housing probationer appeals within 
MSAC (OPM’s oversight and 
adjudicative body) would additionally 
separate the adjudicative function 
within OPM from OPM’s policymaking 
function, which is housed in its 
Workforce Policy & Innovation (WPI) 
office.
51
OPM would continue to 
maintain appropriate administrative 
separation between its policy arm (WPI) 
and adjudication arm (MSAC). 
Meanwhile, MSPB has been 
considerably backlogged due to a 
protracted period without a quorum that 
leaves employees and agencies in limbo. 
Between January 7, 2017, and March 3, 
2022, and between April 10 and October 
27, 2025, MSPB lacked a quorum, which 
prevented it from reviewing cases and 
resulted in a considerable backlog.
52
In 
light of the Senate’s failure to confirm 
nominees to the MSPB in a timely way, 
a process over which the executive 
branch lacks any meaningful control, 
prudent governance requires the 
executive to minimize disruption in 
personnel operations caused by loss of 
a quorum at MSPB. MSPB too has 
mitigated, as far as practicable, the 
effects of a future lack of quorum on 
delays. 89 FR 72957 (Sept. 9, 2024). 
However, this lack of faith in its own 
ability to timely adjudicate appeals 
provides additional evidence of the 
prudence of relocating probationer 
appeals to MSAC. While employees may 
lack some procedural mechanisms if 
appeals are transferred to MSAC as 
contemplated by this rule, OPM believes 
streamlining the process will not have a 
consequential impact upon the 
substantive outcomes of the appeals, 
while improving the efficiency and 
consistency of the process. 
The proposed § 751.101(a) also 
establishes that an individual serving a 
probationary period does not have a 
right to appeal their termination under 
this part if the individual has completed 
one year of current continuous service 
under other than a temporary 
appointment limited to 1 year or less 
and is not otherwise excluded by the 
provisions of that subpart. Instead, the 
appropriate procedures established 
under 5 CFR part 432 or 752 may apply 
unless otherwise excluded by the 
provisions of those parts. OPM notes 
that it has proposed to amend 
referenced provisions of 5 CFR parts 432 
and 752 in its rulemaking under RIN 
3206–AO80 (90 FR 17182); however, the 
cross-references proposed in this rule 
would be unaffected by the changes 
proposed in that rulemaking. 
The proposed § 751.101(b) establishes 
the burden of proof as a ‘‘preponderance 
of the evidence’’ standard when 
establishing the timeliness of the 
appeal, OPM jurisdiction, and the 
appealable issues under § 751.101(c), 
and places that burden of proof on the 
employee. 
The proposed § 751.101(c) establishes 
the appealable issues appellants may 
raise to OPM. These issues mirror those 
under subpart I and the now-rescinded 
subpart H 315 with one exception. OPM 
is not proposing to continue to allow 
appellants to attach complaints of 
discrimination that would otherwise be 
heard by the EEOC. OPM believes the 
EEOC is better suited to adjudicate these 
matters given its expertise in 
administering and overseeing the anti- 
discrimination laws. Removing these 
issues from the probationary or trial 
period appeals process would also 
improve the efficiency in resolving 
probationary and trial period 
termination appeals. 
The proposed § 751.101(d) explains 
that no other issues may be appealed 
under this part. 
The proposed § 751.101(e) establishes 
the procedures in this section as the sole 
and exclusive means for resolving 
appeals from terminations during

respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a 
covered position in any agency’’). 
would be able to appeal an action before 
E.O. 14284. 
The CSRA ‘‘creates an integrated 
scheme of administrative and judicial 
review, wherein the Congress 
intentionally provided—and 
intentionally chose not to provide— 
particular forums and procedures for 
particular kinds of claims.’’
53
Congress 
allowed certain individual Federal 
employees who are affected by agency 
personnel decisions to challenge those 
decisions ‘‘by litigating their claims 
through the statutory scheme in the 
context of [a] concrete’’ dispute, with 
limitations imposed by Congress on the 
kinds of claims and remedies 
available.
54
 
The CSRA’s review scheme is both 
‘‘comprehensive and exclusive.’’
55
It is 
‘‘comprehensive’’ in that ‘‘[i]t regulates 
virtually every aspect of federal 
employment and prescribes in great 
detail the protections and remedies 
applicable to adverse personnel actions, 
including the availability of 
administrative and judicial review.’’
56
It 
is ‘‘exclusive,’’ meanwhile, in that ‘‘[i]t 
constitutes the remedial regime for 
federal employment and personnel 
complaints.’’
57
 
The CSRA’s review scheme is 
exclusive even when ‘‘the CSRA 
provides no relief,’’ and in fact, 
‘‘precludes other avenues of relief.’’
58
In 
other words, ‘‘the CSRA is the exclusive 
avenue for suit even if the plaintiff 
cannot prevail in a claim under the 
CSRA.’’
59
‘‘Congress designed the 
CSRA’s remedial scheme with care, 
‘intentionally providing—and 
intentionally not providing—particular 
forums and procedures for particular 
kinds of claims.’ ’’
60
 
In contrast to covered employees, 
probationers generally do not enjoy the 
same guaranteed right to appeal 
termination decisions to the MSPB, as 
Congress excluded them from the 
definition of ‘‘employee[s]’’ for purposes 
of the CSRA’s Chapter 75.
61
Instead, 
probationers are still considered 
‘‘applicants’’ under the extended hiring 
and evaluation period of the CSRA.
62
 
And the CSRA, which sets forth the 
Merit System Principles underlying the 
entire statutory scheme and provides 
remedies for alleged violations of those 
principles, generally applies to both 
‘‘applicants and employees.’’
63
 
Therefore, the administrative review 
scheme provided in this regulation is 
the sole and exclusive means for a 
probationary employee to appeal his or 
her termination. The proposed § 751.102 
establishes where appeals and 
reconsiderations are filed at OPM and a 
30-day deadline from the effective date 
of the action from which appeal is 
taken. OPM is proposing to require 
appeals to be filed electronically and for 
all parties and their representatives to 
register with OPM’s electronic filing 
system. However, OPM may exempt a 
party or representative from the 
electronic filing requirements for good 
cause shown. All appeals, 
reconsiderations, evidence, orders, 
decisions, and other documents 
generated by this process will be 
officially served through the electronic 
filing system absent an exception 
granted by OPM. 
The proposed § 751.103(a), (b), and (c) 
establish the form, content, and 
deadlines of an employee’s initial 
appeal, the agency’s response, and the 
employee’s reply. The proposed 
§ 751.103(d) allows the employee, the 
employee’s representative, and the 
agency to review the appellate record 
upon request. It also provides that any 
information provided by one party must 
be made available to the other parties. 
The proposed § 751.104 prescribes the 
right for an employee to choose a 
representative subject to certain 
limitations. This language mirrors the 
limitations in 5 CFR 511.608; however 
it also restricts employees from 
providing representation while in a duty 
status. 
The proposed § 751.105 establishes 
the procedures OPM will follow in 
adjudicating appeals. Paragraph (a) 
establishes a conflict-of-interest 
provision that precludes OPM personnel 
from adjudicating an appeal if the 
employee was subject to a covered 
action or served as a representative of an 
employee subject to a covered action 
during the preceding two years. 
Paragraph (b) provides for an 
administrative law judge to adjudicate 
an appeal filed by an OPM employee. In 
this proposal, OPM is adopting an 
approach similar to that used by the 
MSPB at 5 CFR 1201.13 to adjudicate 
appeals arising from its employees. 
Paragraph (c) establishes a procedure for 
OPM to audit or investigate an agency’s 
probationary or trial period termination 
to ascertain additional facts for use in 
adjudicating an appeal, similar to how 
OPM conducts classification appeals at 
5 CFR 511.609. Where OPM conducts an 
audit or investigation to ascertain 
additional facts, it will provide the 
parties with the results and provide a 
reasonable opportunity to submit 
arguments or additional information in 
support of their positions. Paragraph (d) 
establishes that OPM will provide 
written notification of its decision. 
Paragraph (e) establishes OPM’s 
authority to award remedies under its 
authority under 5 U.S.C. 1103(a)(5) and 
5596(b). Where OPM grants an 
employee’s appeal, it will order relief 
including correction of the personnel 
action and any back pay, interest, and 
reasonable attorney fees consistent with 
5 CFR part 550 subpart H. Paragraph (e) 
also establishes that if an agency timely 
requests reconsideration of an initial 
decision or OPM reopens and 
reconsiders an initial decision, the 
agency must continue to provide the 
relief ordered unless OPM issued an 
order staying any such relief. OPM will 
not order a stay, however, that would 
deprive pay and benefits to a prevailing 
employee while the initial decision is 
pending reconsideration. 
The proposed § 751.106 describes the 
process for sanctions and protective 
orders. MSPB procedures, while 
providing for protective orders, are 
inadequate to protect Federal employees 
from threats and harassment. While 
MSPB permits a party to petition the 
board for a protective order, it cannot, 
sua sponte, bind a party to a protective 
order without a motion. Instead, MSPB 
relies primarily on mutual consent of 
the parties, which allows for significant 
abuse by bad actors. The failure to 
preemptively issue an order provides 
ample opportunity to those who would 
channel unwarranted attention, 
harassing messages, and threats to 
Federal employees, who neither sought 
nor deserve public attention, merely for 
fulfilling their responsibilities. This 
failure should be corrected to protect 
rank and file Federal employees seeking 
to serve the public interest. However, 
unfortunately, to date, MSPB has proven 
itself unwilling to take necessary steps 
to protect Federal employees, who 
deserve to be fully protected from 
harassment. As such, OPM believes it 
would be prudent and provide much

needed protection for Federal 
employees to adjudicate these appeals 
by issuing cease-and-desist directives, 
with strict consequences for failure to 
comply. 
The proposed § 751.107 establishes a 
procedure for employees or their 
representatives and agencies to seek 
reconsideration of an initial decision. 
Paragraph (a) establishes a timeline of 
30 days from the date the decision is 
issued for a party to seek 
reconsideration. Paragraph (b) 
establishes the grounds upon which 
OPM may grant a request for 
reconsideration. Paragraph (c) 
establishes the actions OPM may take 
when an initial decision is reopened or 
reviewed. Paragraph (d) prescribes what 
actions OPM may take upon reopening 
or reconsidering an initial decision. 
The proposed § 751.108 establishes 
that the Director may act at his or her 
discretion to reopen and reconsider any 
decision in which OPM issued a final 
decision. 
The proposed § 751.109 describes the 
process by which OPM’s initial decision 
becomes its final decision. The section 
proposes that initial decisions become 
final when neither party requests 
reconsideration within 30 days. It 
further proposes to convert a 
reconsidered opinion into a final 
decision 30 days following its issuance 
if the Director does not intercede but, in 
such cases, backdates the date on which 
the final decision becomes effective to 
the date on which the reconsidered 
opinion is issued. In instances in which 
the Director does intercede, this section 
proposes to define a final decision as 
effective as of the date on which the 
Director issues his or her decision.
64
 
Finally, the section proposes to limit 
further rights to appeal following a final 
agency decision, including judicial 
review. 
OPM views this appellate process as 
necessary to ensure that the Director is 
able to sufficiently supervise 
adjudicators and avoid any serious 
constitutional concerns from having 
subordinate officials wield executive 
authority. Under Article II, the 
Constitution vests the executive power 
in the President who must rely upon 
subordinates to exercise his authority. 
Adjudicators assigned to adjudicate 
appeals under this proposed rule exert 
significant authority that must be 
properly supervised by a principal 
officer appointed by the President with 
Senate consent to avoid a constitutional 
problem. United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1 (2021). 
OPM is also considering whether to 
amend Rule 11 (5 CFR part 11) to 
include certain provisions from E.O. 
14284. Specifically, paragraphs (b)–(d) 
of Section 5 set forth certain procedures 
for agencies to follow as part of their 
certification process for continued 
employment of employees serving 
probationary or trial periods. For 
example, paragraph (b) of Section 5 
requires agencies to meet with each 
employee serving an initial probationary 
or trial period at least 60 days prior to 
the end of their probationary or trial 
period. Although these provisions are 
already in effect and controlling, these 
procedures within E.O. 14284 are not 
currently reflected in Rule 11. OPM is 
considering whether incorporating these 
provisions into the regulations would 
provide administrative convenience for 
employees and human resources 
practitioners. OPM welcomes comments 
on whether and how it should modify 
Rule 11 to explicitly incorporate these 
provisions of Section 5(b)–(d) of E.O. 
14284. 
Finally, OPM proposes to modify its 
regulations under parts 432 and 752 to 
conform to E.O. 14284. The proposed 
changes in § 432.102 remove reference 
in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) to a trial 
period that employees in the 
competitive service may serve. 
Similarly, the proposed changes to 
§§ 752.201 and 752.401 remove 
references to trial periods for employees 
in the competitive service. Under E.O. 
14284 and 5 CFR 11.2 and 11.3, 
employees in the competitive service 
serve probationary periods while 
employees in the excepted service serve 
trial periods. OPM also proposes 
modifying paragraph (f)(3) and adding a 
new (f)(4) to clarify that preference 
eligible and nonpreference eligible 
employees serving a trial period that 
have not completed one or two years of 
current continuous service, respectively, 
may not appeal an action under this 
part. These changes are consistent with 
and necessary to conform to E.O. 14284 
and 5 CFR 11.5 that preclude employees 
serving a trial period from appealing an 
action under part 432 or failure of an 
agency to certify their appointment 
advances the public interest. 
III. Regulatory Analysis 
A. Statement of Need 
OPM is issuing this proposed rule to 
issue regulations under Section 11.6 of 
Civil Service Rule XI and 5 U.S.C. 1103. 
This proposed rule follows the issuance 
of E.O. 14284 which rescinded the 
regulations in subpart H of part 315 of 
this chapter, including the 
circumstances and procedures for filing 
an appeal from termination during a 
probationary period. Thus, the purpose 
of this rulemaking is to prescribe the 
circumstances under and procedures by 
which employees terminated from a 
probationary or trial period may appeal 
to OPM. OPM believes this rule 
balances the needs of promoting greater 
accountability of the Federal workforce 
while also providing an avenue for 
employees to appeal terminations they 
believe are contrary to some covered 
Merit System Principles, or when they 
believe an agency failed to follow 
procedures for terminations based upon 
pre-appointment reasons. The rule also 
proposes to streamline the adjudication 
of appeals currently before the MSPB 
which provide for legal discovery and a 
right to a hearing, which are neither 
necessary for reviewing these types of 
appeals nor conducive to the efficient 
administration of the civil service. This 
proposal would also give OPM 
jurisdiction over appeals from 
supervisors and managers assigned to 
nonsupervisory and nonmanagerial 
positions for failing their probationary 
period. This is necessary to streamline 
the procedures of all appeals related to 
probationary periods and promote 
consistency between how such 
probationary periods are treated. 
B. Regulatory Alternatives 
An alternative to this rulemaking is a 
rule that would mirror the appeal rights 
and procedures under subpart H of part 
315 including allowing employees to 
file appeals with the MSPB. Continuing 
to allow employees to appeal to the 
MSPB would not be as efficient as OPM 
adjudicating appeals. MSPB procedures 
unnecessarily add complexity to a 
process designed for Federal agencies to 
evaluate whether it is in the public’s 
interest to retain employees newly hired 
into the Federal service. When 
appealing to the MSPB, employees have 
a statutory right to a hearing when the 
matter is within its jurisdiction.
65
And 
before reaching a hearing, MSPB 
regulations allow the parties to engage 
in discovery.
66
These procedures 
unnecessarily delay and increase costs 
of the adjudication of appeals that could 
be more efficiently accomplished by 
limiting the transactional costs of 
litigation and adjudication. Further, 
OPM believes that the costs and 
resources associated with MSPB appeals 
processes have been one factor that has 
inhibited supervisors from fully

utilizing probationary periods.
67
As 
discussed in more detail in sections 
III.C., III.D., and III.E., OPM does not 
believe that returning appeals of 
probationary actions to MSPB is the best 
alternative for the Government or 
employees. 
OPM also considered whether to 
include an agency’s failure to provide 
written notice required under 5 CFR 
11.5(e) as a basis for appeal. OPM 
concluded that allowing an appeal on 
this basis would be unnecessary for two 
reasons. First, employees serving a 
probationary or trial period understand 
that, as a condition of employment, 
their employment will conclude before 
the end of their tour of duty on the last 
day of their appointment unless the 
agency issues the certification required 
under 5 CFR 11.5. Second, an agency’s 
failure to adhere to a purely 
administrative requirement would not 
affect the outcome of the employee’s 
separation. 
Another alternative to this rulemaking 
is to not issue a rule that provides 
covered employees with a right to 
appeal. However, employees terminated 
during their probationary or trial 
periods would not be able to seek relief 
for discrimination based on partisan 
political reasons or marital status. 
Supervisors and managers reassigned to 
nonsupervisory or nonmaterial 
positions would still be allowed to 
appeal to the MSPB under subpart I of 
part 315, which OPM views as 
suboptimal given the efficiency gains 
from OPM adjudicating these appeals 
under its own authority. 
We considered whether to include as 
a basis for appeal the circumstances 
described in the proposed § 751.101(d). 
We view an agency’s inaction or 
decision not to finalize an employee’s 
appointment beyond the probationary or 
trial period as the natural conclusion of 
the appointment akin to the expiration 
of a term employee’s appointment.
68
 
Under OPM regulations, the Board 
similarly views an agency’s inaction to 
renew or extend a term employee’s 
appointment beyond the initial term as 
not an appealable adverse action.
69
 
We also conclude that granting 
employees a right to appeal the OPM 
Director’s decision to deny an agency’s 
petition to reinstate an employee to the 
Federal service under 5 CFR 11.5(f) is 
inappropriate. Consistent with our view 
that the employee’s appointment 
naturally comes to an end as described 
in 5 CFR 11.5(a), the agency and not the 
employee retains the right to seek the 
OPM Director’s approval to reinstate the 
employee. It would be inconsistent with 
E.O. 14284 and 5 CFR 11.5 to establish 
a right to challenge the OPM Director’s 
decision to deny a petition from the 
agency given the nature of the 
employee’s appointment and the lack of 
standing of the employee. 
C. Impact 
The proposed rule promotes greater 
accountability of the Federal workforce 
while delivering cost-savings to the 
American taxpayer. Streamlining the 
appeals process by reducing 
unnecessary legal processes to 
adjudicate a narrow set of appealable 
issues and locating adjudicative 
responsibilities at OPM would produce 
a net savings in terms of both costs and 
efficiency of government 
administration. Although employees 
who might otherwise obtain 
adjudication of collateral claims of 
discrimination would need to file 
complaints with the EEOC, the 
adjudication of those claims at the 
EEOC may result in better outcomes as 
the EEOC administers and oversees 
nearly all anti-discrimination laws 
protecting Federal employees. 
Employees seeking relief before the 
EEOC may also experience longer times 
to receive a decision given the number 
of cases pending charges at the end of 
Fiscal Year 2024.
70
However, employees 
will gain the ability to bypass delays in 
the processing of their complaints by 
filing a lawsuit in Federal district court 
under certain circumstances.
71
 
D. Costs 
This proposed rule, once finalized 
and in effect, would affect how Federal 
employees pursue appeals from 
terminations during their probationary 
or trial periods and reassignments to 
nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial 
positions. This proposal grants authority 
over adjudication of these appeals to 
OPM. The proposed rule also removes 
authority from the MSPB to adjudicate 
complaints of discrimination that could 
attach to appeals from terminations 
during a probationary period. 
The grant of adjudicative 
responsibility to OPM will likely result 
in net cost savings for the Government 
for two reasons. First, the proposed rule 
streamlines the adjudicative process by 
replacing discovery with an as-needed 
investigation or audit conducted by 
OPM. The parties will no longer have a 
right or ability to conduct discovery 
which can result in extensive, needless 
costs, including time spent on 
document production, depositions, and 
written discovery, each of which 
involve extensive costs in time and 
resources for the Government. It also 
eliminates an employee’s right to a 
hearing in favor of decisions based on 
the written record unless OPM 
determines that a hearing is both 
necessary and will result in an efficient 
adjudication. Second, the rule locates 
the adjudicative function at OPM, 
resulting in significant cost savings 
based on a reduction in personnel 
salaries as detailed below.
72
 
Based on the most recent publicly 
available annual report of the MSPB, 
622 employees filed appeals from their 
terminations during their probationary 
or trial periods and reassignments to 
nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial 
positions in Fiscal Year 2024.
73
While 
OPM acknowledges the significant 
number of appeals filed since agencies 
undertook termination actions after the 
change in Administration on January 20, 
2025, this period of time appears to be 
an anomaly and not a sustainable trend. 
Employees filed 486, 424, and 461 
‘‘Termination of Probationer’’ appeals 
from Fiscal Years 2021–2023,
74
 
respectively. Therefore, for the purposes 
of this analysis, OPM assumes an 
average of 457 appeals of probationer 
terminations per year. 
One-Time Costs 
OPM estimates that this rulemaking 
will require individuals employed by 
more than 80 Federal agencies including 
the MSPB and EEOC to modify their 
regulations, policies, and procedures to 
implement this rulemaking and train 
human resources (HR) practitioners, 
hiring managers, attorneys, and

administrative judges. For the purpose 
of this cost analysis, the assumed 
average salary rate of Federal employees 
performing this work will be the rate in 
2025 for GS–14, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($161,486 annual locality rate and 
$77.38 hourly locality rate). We assume 
that the total dollar value of labor, 
which includes wages, benefits, and 
overhead, is equal to 200 percent of the 
wage rate, resulting in an assumed labor 
cost of $154.76 per hour. 
To comply with the regulatory 
changes, affected agencies would need 
to review the final rule and update their 
regulations, policies, and procedures. 
We estimate that, in the first year 
following publication of the final rule, 
doing so will require an average of 100 
hours of work by employees with an 
average hourly cost of $154.76. This 
work would result in estimated costs in 
that first year of implementation of 
about $15,476 per agency, and about 
$1.2 million governmentwide. 
Recurring Costs/Savings 
OPM believes this rulemaking will 
not substantially increase the cost to 
agencies in litigating terminations 
during employees’ probationary or trial 
periods and reassignments to 
nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial 
positions. OPM first calculated the cost 
of shifting complaints of discrimination 
raised in probationary appeals from the 
MSPB to the EEOC. OPM assumes that 
an extremely conservative rate of 100% 
of appellants (457) also seek counseling 
with their agency’s EEO office. OPM 
expects that an existing EEO Specialists 
would process employees’ complaints of 
discrimination at the rate in 2025 for 
GS–12, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table ($114,923 annual 
locality rate and $55.07 hourly locality 
rate) with about 16 hours of pre- 
complaint processing for each 
complaint.
75
OPM assumes that the total 
dollar value of labor, which includes 
wages, benefits, and overhead, is equal 
to 200 percent of the wage rate, resulting 
in an assumed labor cost of $110.14 per 
hour. OPM estimates that the total cost 
to the Federal Government for EEO pre- 
complaint is approximately $805,000. 
After the EEO pre-complaint process, 
OPM estimates that 174 complaints will 
proceed to an investigation. OPM 
assumes that the complaint processing 
will be performed by EEO Specialists 
paid at the rate in 2025 for GS–12, step 
5, from the Washington, DC, locality pay 
table ($114,923 annual locality rate and 
$55.07 hourly locality rate), to perform 
a total of 30 hours of investigative work 
for each complaint. OPM also assumes 
that the total dollar value of labor, 
which includes wages, benefits, and 
overhead, is equal to 200 percent of the 
wage rate, resulting in an assumed labor 
cost of $110.14 per hour. OPM estimates 
that the total cost to the Federal 
Government for EEO investigations is 
approximately $575,000. 
Following the investigative stage, 
OPM assumes that 76 complaints will 
proceed to a final agency decision while 
30 will be adjudicated by an EEOC 
administrative judge. In drafting and 
issuing a final agency decision, OPM 
estimates that agencies will employ one 
EEO Specialist paid at the rate in 2025 
for GS–12, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table ($114,923 annual 
locality rate and $55.07 hourly locality 
rate) to perform 12 hours of work to 
draft the decision; and one EEO Director 
paid at the GS–15, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($189,950 annual locality rate and 
$91.06 hourly locality rate) to perform 4 
hours of work to review and sign the 
decision. OPM also assumes that the 
total dollar value of labor, which 
includes wages, benefits, and overhead, 
is equal to 200 percent of the wage rate, 
resulting in an assumed labor cost of 
$110.14 and $182.04 per hour, 
respectively. OPM estimates that the 
total cost to the Federal Government to 
issue 76 final agency decisions is 
approximately $156,000. 
Assuming all probationer appeals 
result in a report of discrimination and 
assuming probationer appellants 
proceed through the EEOC process in 
rates similar to employees solely raising 
discrimination claims, the number of 
complaints filed with the EEOC would 
rise no greater than 6.5% based on the 
most recent publicly available data.
76
In 
adjudicating the 30 cases filed with the 
EEOC, OPM assumes that an EEOC 
administrative judge paid at the rate in 
2025 for GS–14, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($161,486 annual locality rate and 
$77.38 hourly locality rate) will 
adjudicate complaints; the chief 
administrative judge paid at the GS–15, 
step 5, from the Washington, DC, 
locality pay table ($189,950 annual 
locality rate and $91.06 hourly locality 
rate) will review the administrative 
judge’s decision; and a paralegal paid at 
the GS–11, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table ($95,878 annual 
locality rate and $45.94 hourly locality 
rate) will assist the administrative judge 
during the adjudicative hearing process. 
OPM also assumes that the total dollar 
value of labor, which includes wages, 
benefits, and overhead, is equal to 200 
percent of the wage rate, resulting in an 
assumed labor cost of $154.76, $182.04, 
and $91.88 per hour, respectively. OPM 
estimates that each complaint will 
require 40, 8, and 4 hours, respectively, 
of an administrative judge, chief 
administrative judge, and paralegal to 
adjudicate each complaint. OPM also 
assumes each case will cost as much as 
$5,000 in miscellaneous litigation costs 
associated with litigation (e.g., court reporter fees, discovery) borne by the 
parties. Therefore, OPM estimates that 
the total cost to adjudicate these 30 
complaints is approximately $390,000. 
OPM also estimates that 12 of the 30 
complaints adjudicated will be appealed 
to the EEOC’s Office of Federal 
Operations. OPM assumes that an EEOC 
attorney paid at the rate in 2025 for GS– 
14, step 5, from the Washington, DC, 
locality pay table ($161,486 annual 
locality rate and $77.38 hourly locality 
rate) will draft and issue the opinion, 
requiring 6 hours of work per appeal. 
OPM also assumes that an EEOC 
paralegal paid at the GS–11, step 5, from 
the Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($95,878 annual locality rate and $45.94 
hourly locality rate) will assist the 
attorney, requiring 2 hours of work. 
OPM also assumes that the total dollar 
value of labor, which includes wages, 
benefits, and overhead, is equal to 200 
percent of the wage rate, resulting in an 
assumed labor cost of $154.76 and 
$91.88 per hour, respectively. Thus, 
OPM calculates that the total cost to 
adjudicate 12 appeals is approximately 
$13,350. 
During the course of processing the 
457 complaints, OPM assumes agencies 
will require the use of agency attorneys 
to advise their EEO offices as well as 
defend against the 30 complaints and 12 
appeals. OPM estimates that an attorney 
paid at the rate in 2025 for GS–13, step 
5, from the Washington, DC, locality pay 
table ($136,658 annual locality rate and 
$65.48 hourly locality rate) will advise 
agency EEO offices on average 8 hours 
per complaint. OPM also estimates that 
an attorney paid at the rate in 2025 for 
GS–13, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table, will defend the 
agency on average 60 hours per 
complaint that proceeds to a hearing 
and 24 hours per appeal. OPM also 
assumes that the total dollar value of 
labor, which includes wages, benefits, 
and overhead, is equal to 200 percent of 
the wage rate, resulting in an assumed

Based on the past decade and the current 
outlook, MSPB is unlikely to have three 
concurrently sitting Board members for the 
foreseeable future. Therefore, OPM has estimated 
the work of only two Board members and staff. 
labor cost of $130.96 per hour. Thus, 
OPM estimates that agencies’ costs for 
attorney services are approximately 
$780,000. The total increased annual 
cost to the Federal Government from 
discrimination claims being handled 
through the EEO process rather than as 
a mixed case with the MSPB would be 
about $1.1 million. OPM expects that 
this estimate exceeds the true cost as a 
result of conservative assumptions (e.g., 
100% of probationer appeals also make 
a claim of discrimination) and likely 
duplication of costs (e.g., some appellants probably already seek EEO 
counseling). 
OPM also examined the costs of an 
adjudication at the MSPB as compared 
to OPM. MSPB employs administrative 
judges at the GS–15 grade level to 
adjudicate appeals. We assume that 
each probationary appeal requires one 
administrative judge paid at the rate in 
2025 for GS–15, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($189,950 annual locality rate and 
$91.02 hourly locality rate); and one 
paralegal at the GS–11, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($95,878 annual locality rate and $45.94 
hourly locality rate). We assume that the 
total dollar value of labor, which 
includes wages, benefits, and overhead, 
is equal to 200 percent of the wage rate, 
resulting in an assumed labor cost of 
$182.04 and $91.88 per hour for these 
respective positions. We estimate that 
each initial appeal of a termination from 
a probationary appeal requires 3 and 1 
hour for an administrative judge and 
paralegal to adjudicate an appeal, 
respectively. A Chief Administrative 
Judge requires about an hour to review 
four cases. Based on these assumptions, 
we estimate the cost for MSPB to 
adjudicate an appeal at about $700 per 
appeal or $316,000 per year for 457 
appeals, the average number of appeals 
over the preceding three-year period. 
In contrast, adjudicating appeals at 
OPM will require adjudicators at the 
rate in 2025 for GS–13, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($136,658 annual locality rate and 
$65.48 hourly locality rate); paralegals 
at the GS–11, step 5, from the 
Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($95,878 annual locality rate and $45.94 
hourly locality rate); and supervisory 
adjudicators at the GS–14, step 5, from 
the Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($161,486 annual locality rate and 
$77.38 hourly locality rate), to 
adjudicate 457 appeals each year. We 
assume that the total dollar value of 
labor, which includes wages, benefits, 
and overhead, is equal to 200 percent of 
the wage rate, resulting in an assumed 
labor cost of $130.96, $91.88, and 
$154.76 per hour for the respective 
positions above. We estimate that each 
appeal will require 30 hours of work 
performed by an adjudicator, 1 hour of 
work by a paralegal, and 1 hours of 
work by a supervisory adjudicator. On 
average, probationer appeals require 
very limited time commitments to 
process because most cases are 
dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. 
Nonetheless, for cases where there is 
jurisdiction, OPM expects that OPM 
adjudication will require less time than 
an MSPB adjudication due to several 
factors. OPM expects that cases will 
rarely require a hearing and that most 
cases will be decided on the written 
record. OPM’s proposed process also 
does not provide for discovery, which is 
often provided in cases before the 
MSPB. In addition to requiring less time 
commitment, OPM expects to have 
employees at lower pay rates adjudicate 
the cases with review by supervisors 
rather than using higher-paid attorneys 
to adjudicate cases as the MSPB does. 
Based on these assumptions, we 
estimate the cost to adjudicate an appeal 
at $640 and $290,000 per year to 
adjudicate 457 appeals. This results in 
a net, recurring savings of about $25,000 
from adjudicating appeals at OPM as 
opposed to MSPB. 
MSPB estimates that it receives 
petitions of review of approximately 
11% of decisions on appeal. Therefore, 
we assume that employees in 46 of the 
457 cases adjudicated will seek 
reconsideration of an initial decision 
issued by OPM. With respect to the 
costs for the MSPB to adjudicate 
petitions for review from initial appeals, 
we estimate that each petition requires 
the Chairman and one Member of the 
MSPB
77
paid at the rate of Executive 
Schedule Level IV of $195,200 ($93.53 
hourly rate); an one attorney paid at the 
GS–15, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table ($189,950 annual 
locality rate and $91.06 hourly locality 
rate); and an attorney paid at the GS–13, 
step 5, from the Washington, DC, 
locality pay table ($136,658 annual 
locality rate and $65.48 hourly locality 
rate). We assume that the total dollar 
value of labor, which includes wages, 
benefits, and overhead, is equal to 200 
percent of the wage rate, resulting in an 
assumed labor cost of $187.06, $182.04, 
and $130.96 for these respective 
positions. We estimate that each 
petition requires 1, 2, and 6 hours, 
respectively, for the Board, GS–15 
attorney, and GS–13 attorney to 
adjudicate. Based on these assumptions, 
we estimate the cost for MSPB to 
adjudicate petitions for review to be 
$550 per petition or about $25,000 per 
year for 46 petitions. 
Reconsideration under the proposed 
rule at OPM will require a GS–14 
adjudications officer, not involved in 
the initial decision, at the rate in 2025 
for GS–14, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table ($161,486 annual 
locality rate and $77.38 hourly locality 
rate); the Associate Director of MSAC at 
the rate for a Senior Executive Service 
member at $225,700 ($108.15 hourly 
rate). We assume that the total dollar 
value of labor, which includes wages, 
benefits, and overhead, is equal to 200 
percent of the wage rate, resulting in an 
assumed labor cost of $154.76, and 
$216.30 per hour for the respective 
positions. We estimate that each appeal 
on reconsideration will require 4 hours 
of work performed by the adjudications 
officer and 1 hour of work by the 
Associate Director for MSAC. OPM 
estimates that a very small number (e.g., 
10) of cases will be reviewed by the 
Director of OPM. Based on these 
assumptions, we estimate the cost of 
OPM reconsidering an appeal at 
approximately $1,835 with $38,500 per 
year for 46 reconsiderations. This 
results in a net, recurring cost of about 
$13,500 for OPM reconsideration of 
appeals. 
OPM also estimated costs to agencies 
to defend against probationary appeals 
filed at the MSPB and OPM. OPM 
estimates that agencies employ one 
attorney paid at the rate of a GS–14, step 
5, from the Washington, DC, locality pay 
table ($161,486 annual locality rate and 
$77.38 hourly locality rate); one 
paralegal paid at the GS–11, step 5, from 
the Washington, DC, locality pay table 
($95,878 annual locality rate and $45.94 
hourly locality rate); and one 
supervisory attorney paid at the rate of 
GS–15, step 5, from the Washington, 
DC, locality pay table ($189,950 annual 
locality rate and $91.06 hourly locality 
rate) to defend against appeals and 
petitions for review filed at the MSPB. 
OPM assumes that agencies will employ 
the same positions paid at the same 
rates of pay for appeals filed at OPM 
under the proposed rule. OPM further 
assumes that the total dollar value of 
labor, which includes wages, benefits, 
and overhead, is equal to 200 percent of 
the wage rate, resulting in an assumed 
labor cost of $154.76, $91.88, and 
$182.04 per hour for the respective 
positions above. However, OPM 
estimates that the amount of labor 
required to defend agencies will be 
lower under the proposed rule. OPM

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61080 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules 78
MSPB, ‘‘The Probationary Period: A Critical 
Assessment Opportunity,’’ August 2005, available 
at https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/The_Probationary_Period_A_Critical_Assessment_Opportunity_224555.pdf. assumes each appeal before the MSPB 
requires 15, 4, and 1 hour of time for an 
attorney, paralegal, and supervisory 
attorney, respectively. And for PFRs, 
agencies require one attorney to work 10 
hours. Under the proposed rule, OPM 
estimates that agencies will require 10, 
4, and 1 hour of time for an attorney, 
paralegal, and supervisory attorney, 
respectively. And for reconsiderations 
of an OPM initial decision, OPM 
estimates that the proposed rule would 
require 8 hours for one attorney. Using 
the cost information above, OPM 
estimates that the total cost to the 
Federal Government for litigation 
defense before the MSPB is $1.4 million, 
and $1 million before OPM. 
In summary, OPM calculates 
increased costs associated with moving 
discrimination claims to the EEOC at 
approximately $2.6 million. Estimated 
costs associated with MSPB continuing 
to adjudicate probationer and trial 
period appeals at $1.759 million versus 
estimate costs of adjudicating those 
cases at OPM at $1.373 million, yielding 
savings of $386,000. These savings 
partially offset the cost of moving 
discrimination claims to the EEOC. 
After considering the costs detailed 
above, we estimate the first-year costs to 
be about $3.5 million governmentwide 
with recurring annual costs to the 
Federal Government of approximately 
$2.3 million. 
E. Benefits 
In addition to the direct cost savings 
this proposed rule would generate, OPM 
expects that the faster adjudication of 
appeals will result in additional 
benefits. First, receiving a timely 
decision on an appeal will provide an 
individual with a clear determination of 
whether the individual will be 
reinstated. Agencies will similarly 
benefit as the streamlined appeal 
procedures proposed in this rule remove 
the default requirement for a hearing 
before a MSPB administrative judge and 
eliminate protracted, costly legal 
discovery between an appellant and 
agency. Second, a timely decision on 
appeal will allow the government to 
limit backpay and attorney’s fees in 
instances where the individual was 
removed in error. 
Because appeals will be limited to 
discrimination based on partisan 
political reasons or marital status, and 
failure to follow procedures for 
terminations based upon pre- 
appointment reasons, OPM also 
anticipates that the proposal will result 
in improved efficiency of the service by 
freeing agencies’ resources for 
facilitating an ongoing assessment of 
whether new positions or new hires are 
meeting the needs of the government. A 
study by the MSPB found that the 
success of probationary periods’ ability 
to find and assess talent to meet 
agencies’ missions and the Federal 
service is dependent upon supervisors’ 
ability to evaluate new talent and take 
appropriate action to prevent less than 
successful candidates from becoming 
Federal employees.
78
By allowing 
supervisors and managers to spend 
more time training, mentoring, and 
evaluating new employees, agencies 
should achieve savings from better 
outcomes with recruiting and retaining 
talent to the Federal service. 
IV. Procedural Issues and Regulatory 
Review 
A. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management certifies that 
this rulemaking will not have a 
significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities 
because the rule involves adjudicative 
authority of Federal agencies to 
adjudicate appeals filed by current and 
former Federal employees. While small 
entities representing current or former 
Federal employees will be impacted by 
the change in venue for appeals and 
complaints of discrimination, the 
procedures employed by the OPM and 
EEOC will not cause significant 
economic impacts on these small 
entities. 
B. Regulatory Review 
OPM has examined the impact of this 
rulemaking as required by Executive 
Orders 12866 (Sept. 30, 1993) and 13563 
(Jan. 18, 2011), which direct agencies to 
assess all costs and benefits of available 
regulatory alternatives and, if regulation 
is necessary, to select regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits. 
A regulatory impact analysis must be 
prepared for major rules with effects of 
$100 million or more in any one year. 
This rulemaking does not reach that 
threshold but has otherwise been 
designated as a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under section 3(f) of Executive 
Order 12866, as supplemented by 
Executive Order 13563. This proposed 
rule is not expected to be an Executive 
Order 14192 regulatory action. 
C. Executive Order 13132, Federalism 
This regulation will not have 
substantial direct effects on the States, 
on the relationship between the 
National Government and the States, or 
on distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. Therefore, in 
accordance with Executive Order 13132 
(Aug. 10, 1999), it is determined that 
this proposed rule does not have 
sufficient federalism implications to 
warrant preparation of a Federalism 
Assessment. 
D. Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice 
Reform 
This regulation meets the applicable 
standards set forth in section 3(a) and 
(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988 (Feb. 7, 
1996). 
E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
This rulemaking will not result in the 
expenditure by State, local, or tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of more than $100 
million annually (adjusted annually for 
inflation with the base year 1995). Thus, 
no written assessment of unfunded 
mandates is required. 
F. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35) 
This regulatory action will not impose 
any reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. OPM is reviewing its 
existing System of Records Notices 
(SORNs) in light of the changes 
proposed in this rulemaking. OPM will 
publish any proposed changes to any 
relevant SORNs in the Federal Register. 
The Director of OPM, Scott Kupor, 
reviewed and approved this document 
and has authorized the undersigned to 
electronically sign and submit this 
document to the Office of the Federal 
Register for publication.

period required under 5 CFR part 11 or 
other authority administered by the 
Office, and 
(ii) Assignment to a nonsupervisory or 
nonmanagerial position for failure to 
complete a supervisory or managerial 
probationary period required under 
subpart I of part 315 of this chapter.

probationary period does not have a 
right to appeal their termination under 
this part if the individual has completed 
one year of current continuous service 
under other than a temporary 
appointment limited to 1 year or less. 
Such individual may have a right to 
appeal under the provisions of 5 CFR 
432.106 or 752.405, as appropriate,

written appeal, 
(2) That OPM possesses jurisdiction 
over the appeal, and 
(3) The agency’s action was

statute, 
(ii) Assignment to a nonsupervisory or 
nonmanagerial position under 315.907

(iii) An agency’s decision not to 
certify the continuation of the 
appointment of an employee serving a 
probationary or trial period, or 
(iv) An agency’s failure to certify and 
finalize the appointment of an employee 
serving a probationary or trial period. 
(2) Improper procedure. An employee whose termination is based in whole or 
part on conditions arising before his or 
her appointment may appeal to OPM 
challenging that the agency failed to 
provide: 
(i) advance written notice stating the 
reasons, specifically and in detail, for 
the proposed action; 
(ii) a reasonable time for filing a 
written answer to the notice of proposed 
adverse action and for furnishing 
affidavits in support of his or her 
answer. If the employee answers, the 
agency shall consider the answer in 
reaching its decision; and 
(iii) a written decision at the earliest 
practicable date delivered at or before 
the effective date of the action. The 
decision shall inform the employee of 
the reasons for the action, the right to 
appeal to OPM, the need to include 
documented supporting facts, and time 
limits within which the appeal must be 
submitted under this Section. 
(d) Nonappealable issues. An employee may not appeal under this 
part any other issue not specified in 
paragraphs (c) of this section. 
(e) Exclusive appeal procedure. The procedures in this Part are the sole and 
exclusive means of appealing 
terminations during probationary or 
trial periods but does not preclude an 
employee from filing a complaint, 
appeal, or other matter within the 
jurisdiction of the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, an Inspector 
General, Merit Systems Protection 
Board, or Office of Special Counsel. A 
party cannot obtain judicial review of a 
decision under this part. 
(f) Definition of employee. For purposes of this part, an employee 
means an individual who was 
appointed: 
(1) to the competitive service as 
described in 5 CFR 11.2 who has not 
completed one year of current 
continuous service under other than a 
temporary appointment limited to one 
year or less; 
(2) to the competitive service and 
serving a probationary period on an 
initial appointment to a supervisory or 
managerial position under subpart I of 
part 315 of this chapter; 
(3) to the competitive service under 
an emergency-indefinite appointment in 
a national emergency serving a 
probationary period under subpart D of 
part 230 of this chapter and who is in 
the first year of service; or 
(4) to the excepted service before the 
end of their first year on an initial 
appointment under part 307 of this 
chapter. Employees serving in an 
appointment in the excepted service 
outside of part 307 are not covered 
under this section and, therefore, may 
not appeal a termination during their 
trial period unless otherwise entitled by 
statute. 
§ 751.102 Procedures for submitting 
appeals. 
(a) Filing an appeal. An employee, or his or her authorized representative, 
seeking to file an appeal or 
reconsideration under this part must 
utilize the electronic filing system 
available at {URL TBD}. Absent an 
exception, OPM will not accept 
pleadings, evidence, or other documents 
via electronic mail or postal mail. 
(b) Time limits. An employee may file an appeal within 30 calendar days from 
the effective date of the action. An 
appeal is deemed timely when it is 
electronically filed by 11:59 p.m. 
Eastern Standard Time on the 30th 
calendar day after the effective date of 
the action. 
(1) In computing the number of days 
allowed for filing an appeal, the first 
day counted is the day after the effective 
date of an Agency action. If the date that 
ordinarily would be the last day for 
filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or 
Federal holiday, the filing period will 
include the first workday after that date. 
(2) If an employee does not file an 
appeal within the time set by this 
section, the appeal will be dismissed as 
untimely filed unless the employee 
demonstrates good cause for an 
untimely appeal. The determination of 
good cause will be in the sole and 
exclusive discretion of OPM. 
(c) E-filing procedures. (1) All parties and their 
representatives to an appeal or 
reconsideration must register as 
instructed by OPM on its probationary 
appeals website using a unique email 
address. 
(2) Registration as an e-filer 
constitutes consent to accept electronic 
service of pleadings, evidence, notices, 
orders, and other documents filed by 
other e-filers or issued by OPM. No 
party may electronically file any 
document with OPM or access an 
appeal or reconsideration of an appeal 
unless registered as an e-filer. 
(3) All notices, orders, decisions, and 
other documents issued by OPM, as 
well as all documents filed by parties, 
will be made available for viewing and 
downloading at OPM’s electronic filing 
system. Access to documents is limited 
to the parties and their representatives 
who are registered e-filers in the cases 
in which they were filed. 
(4) All parties and their 
representatives must follow the 
instructions on OPM’s website for 
properly filing all pleadings, evidence, 
and other documents. OPM may strike 
a document where an e-filer repeatedly 
fails to follow these instructions 
subsequent to a show cause order. 
(5) Each e-filer must promptly update 
their profile in OPM’s electronic filing 
system and notify OPM and other 
parties of any change in their address, 
telephone number, or email address by 
filing a pleading in each pending case 
with which they are associated. E-filers 
are responsible for monitoring case 
activity regularly in OPM’s electronic 
filing system to ensure that they have 
received all case-related documents. 
(6) A party or representative may 
withdraw their registration as an e-filer 
pursuant to the requirements posted on 
OPM’s website. Withdrawing 
registration in OPM’s electronic filing 
system means that, effective upon 
OPM’s processing of a proper 
withdrawal, pleadings, evidence, orders, 
and other documents filed by a party or 
party’s representative and OPM will no 
longer be served on that person 
electronically and that person will no 
longer have electronic access to their 
case records through OPM’s electronic 
filing system. OPM may still process an 
appeal or request for reconsideration 
after a party withdraws as an e-filer. 
Withdrawal as a party or party’s 
representative will not be considered 
good cause for staying a case. As the e- 
file system is the only accepted method 
for filing an appeal, a withdrawal of 
registration as an e-filer may preclude 
future re-registering as an e-filer. 
(7) OPM, in its sole and exclusive 
discretion, may exempt a party or 
representative from registering as an e- 
filer for good cause. A party or 
representative must promptly contact 
OPM as instructed on OPM’s website to 
request an exemption from the e-filing 
requirements in this Part. OPM will not 
find good cause for failing to timely file 
an appeal or seek reconsideration if the 
party or representative fails to contact 
OPM to request an exemption before 
any deadline to appeal or seek 
reconsideration. 
(8) Documents filed in OPM’s 
electronic filing system are deemed

submission. 
§ 751.103 Form and content of 
probationary or trial period appeal and 
agency response. 
(a) Initial appeal. An employee’s appeal shall be in writing and shall state 
the basis of the employee’s appeal; the 
name, address, and email address or 
phone number of the appellant and 
appellant’s representative, if any; and 
any documentation supporting the 
appellant’s appeal. 
(b) Agency response. The agency response to an appeal must be filed 
within 30 calendar days of the initial 
appeal; contain the name of the 
appellant and of the agency whose 
action the appellant is appealing; a 
statement identifying the agency action 
taken against the appellant and stating 
the reasons for taking the action; all 
documents contained in the agency 
record of the action; designation of and 
signature by the authorized agency 
representative; and any other 
documents or responses requested by 
the Office. The agency’s 30 calendar 
days to respond begins upon service of 
the appeal. 
(c) Reply. An employee may file a reply to an agency response to an initial 
appeal within 15 calendar days of the 
agency response. The reply may only 
address the factual and legal issues 
raised by the agency in response to the 
initial appeal. The reply may not raise 
new allegations of error. 
(d) Inspection of OPM’s appellate record. The employee, an employee’s representative, and the agency will be 
permitted to inspect OPM’s appellate 
record on request. 
(e) Service of documents. The employee, employee’s representative, 
and agency will serve on each other 
copies of any and all information 
submitted to OPM with respect to an 
appeal. Such information must be 
served on all other parties at the same 
time the information is submitted to 
OPM and must be accompanied by a 
certificate of service stating how and 
when service was made. 
(f) Untimely filings. Untimely filings may be accepted upon a party’s showing 
of good cause at the sole and exclusive 
discretion of OPM. 
§ 751.104 Employee representatives. 
An appellant may select a 
representative of his or her choice to 
assist in the preparation and 
presentation of an appeal, provided that 
the appellant submits his or her 
designation of representative in writing 
related to the specific appeal. If the 
selected representative is a Federal 
employee, the representative may not 
perform such representational functions 
while in a duty status (including while 
on official time under 5 U.S.C. 7131), 
nor may the representative claim agency 
reimbursement for any expenses 
incurred while performing such 
representational function. OPM or the 
responsible agency may, in its sole and 
exclusive discretion, disallow an 
appellant’s choice of representative 
when the representative is an employee 
of the responsible agency or OPM and 
his or her activities as a representative 
would cause a conflict of interest or 
position; that employee cannot be 
released from his or her official duties 
because of the priority needs of the 
Government; or that employee’s release 
would give rise to unreasonable costs to 
the Government. 
§ 751.105 Adjudication of appeals. 
(a) Appeals by non-OPM employees. OPM will assign personnel to adjudicate 
an appeal under this subpart by an 
employee of an agency other than OPM. 
However, no employee may be assigned 
to adjudicate an appeal if the employee 
has a relationship with the appellant or, 
during the preceding two years, that 
person was an employee of the agency 
that is party to the action to be assigned. 
When necessary, OPM may appoint an 
administrative law judge to preside over 
the adjudication of an appeal. 
(b) Appeals by OPM employees. OPM will assign an administrative law judge 
to adjudicate an appeal under this 
subpart by an OPM employee. To 
insulate the adjudication of its own 
employees’ appeals from agency 
involvement, OPM will not disturb 
initial decisions in those cases unless a 
party shows that there has been harmful 
procedural irregularity in the 
proceedings before the administrative 
law judge or a clear error of law. For 
these purposes, the term harmful 
procedural irregularity means an 
irregularity in the application of 
procedures was likely to have caused 
the administrative law judge to reach a 
conclusion different from the one it 
would have reached in the absence or 
cure of the irregularity. 
(c) Ascertainment of facts. OPM may audit or investigate an agency’s 
termination action in the course of 
adjudicating an appeal if it determines, 
in its sole and exclusive discretion, that 
such an audit or investigation is in the 
interest of justice . An individual 
serving as a representative of either 
party may not participate in an audit or 
investigation unless OPM specifically 
requests them to do so. The review of 
an agency action must be based solely 
on the developed written record unless 
OPM determines that a hearing is 
necessary and efficient to resolve an 
appeal. For purposes of this section, the 
terms necessary and efficient means circumstances in which the written 
record is insufficiently developed to 
make a determination regarding one or 
more facts material to the outcome of 
the appeal, or where there is a disputed 
issue of witness credibility that is 
material to the outcome of the appeal. 
Where an investigation or audit is 
conducted, OPM will: 
(1) Inform the employee, the 
employee’s representative, and the 
agency of an investigation or audit, and 
(2) Provide the employee, the 
employee’s representative, and the 
agency with the results of an 
investigation or audit, and a reasonable 
opportunity to submit arguments or 
additional information to support their 
positions. 
(d) Initial decision. OPM will notify the employee, employee’s 
representative, and agency in writing of 
its decision. 
(e) Remedies. (1) If the employee is the prevailing 
party, OPM will order relief including 
correction of the personnel action and 
any back pay, interest, and reasonable 
attorney fees consistent with subpart H 
of part 550 of this chapter. The 
employee as a prevailing party is not 
entitled to compensatory damages or 
other relief not authorized under 5 
U.S.C. 5596(b). 
(2) If the agency timely requests 
reconsideration of an initial decision or 
the OPM reopens and reconsiders an 
initial decision, the agency must 
continue to provide the relief ordered 
unless OPM issues an order staying any 
such relief. No such stay may be ordered 
that would deprive pay and benefits to 
the employee while the initial decision 
is pending reconsideration. 
§ 751.106 Sanctions and protective orders. 
(a) Cease-and desist directive. OPM may issue a directive to a party to 
prevent or to cease-and-desist harassing 
communications (or communications 
which could reasonably be foreseen to 
lead to harassment) with or about any 
individual, or to prohibit a party from 
using any information related to the 
appeal for any purpose whatsoever 
unrelated to the adjudication of the 
appeal. OPM may do this sua sponte, or 
at the request of a party, preemptively 
or at any juncture in the appeal process. 
A party requesting OPM to issue a 
protective order or cease-and-desist 
should file such request using the e- 
filing procedures proscribed at 
§ 751.102(c), and must include 
statement of reasons justifying the

documentary evidence. 
(b) Failure to comply with an OPM directive. When a party to an appeal fails to comply with an order issued 
under subsection (a), OPM may, except 
when prohibited by law: 
(1) Draw all inferences in opposition 
to the noncompliant party with regard 
to the appeal in question; 
(2) Prohibit the noncompliant party 
from introducing evidence, or 
additional evidence, concerning the 
appeal, or otherwise relying on the 
record; or 
(3) Eliminate from consideration any 
appropriate part of the filings or other 
submissions of the noncompliant party. 
§ 751.107 Requests for reconsideration of 
an initial decision. 
(a) Upon a request from either party 
to the dispute or upon its own initiative, 
OPM may, in its sole and exclusive 
discretion, reopen and reconsider an 
initial decision issued under this 
subpart. An employee, the employee’s 
representative, or agency may request 
reconsideration of an initial decision 
within 30 calendar days from issuance 
of the decision. The request for 
reconsideration must be filed as 
directed in the initial decision. 
(b) Grounds for which OPM may grant 
a request for reconsideration are: 
(1) The initial decision contains 
erroneous findings of material fact 
sufficient to warrant an outcome 
different from that of the initial 
decision; 
(2) The initial decision is based on an 
erroneous interpretation of statute or 
regulation or the erroneous application 
of the law to the facts of the case. The 
party must explain how the error 
affected the outcome of the case; 
(3) New and material evidence or 
legal argument is available that, despite 
the party’s due diligence, was not 
available when the record closed. To 
constitute new evidence, the 
information contained in the 
documents, not just the documents 
themselves, must have been unavailable 
despite due diligence when the record 
closed; or 
(4) OPM finds good cause to 
reconsider an appeal. 
(c) In any case that is reopened or 
reviewed, OPM may: 
(1) Issue a reopened and reconsidered 
decision (‘‘R&R decision’’) that affirms, 
reverses, modifies, vacates, or otherwise 
decides the case, in whole or in part; 
(2) Require the parties to submit 
argument and evidence; 
(3) Take any other action necessary 
for final disposition of the case; and 
(4) Issue an order with a date for 
compliance with the R&R decision. 
(d) There is no further right of 
administrative appeal from the R&R 
decision. 
§ 751.108 Review by the OPM Director. 
The Director may, at his or her 
discretion, sua sponte, reopen and reconsider any appeal in which OPM 
has issued a decision that has not yet 
become final. 
§ 751.109 Final decision. 
(a) The initial decision becomes 
OPM’s final decision if a party does not 
request OPM to reopen or reconsider the 
initial decision, or OPM does not do so 
on its own initiative, within 30 calendar 
days from the date of the initial 
decision. 
(b) A R&R decision pursuant to 
§ 751.107 becomes OPM’s final decision 
if the OPM Director does not reopen the 
decision pursuant to § 751.108 within 
30 calendar days from the date on 
which the R&R decision was issued. 
(c) A decision by the Director 
pursuant to § 751.108 is the final 
decision of OPM and effective upon 
issuance. 
(d) There is no further right of appeal 
of a final decision of OPM. 
(e) OPM shall maintain a publicly 
accessible website containing all final 
decisions issued on this part that 
address a party’s claim on the merits. 
Any final decision not made publicly 
available shall be made available upon 
request by a concerned party. For 
purposes of this subsection, a concerned 
party means the Federal employee or former Federal employee involved in a 
proceeding under this subpart, his or 
her representative selected pursuant to 
§ 751.104, or a representative of a 
Federal agency or office.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The 2008 financial crisis 
demonstrated the destabilizing effect 
that large, interconnected financial 
companies can have on the national 
economy, capital markets, and the 
overall financial stability of the banking 
system. Following the financial crisis, 
the OCC developed a set of ‘‘heightened 
expectations’’ to enhance the agency’s 
supervision and strengthen the 
governance and risk management 
practices of large institutions.
1
In 2010, 
the OCC began communicating these 
heightened expectations informally to 
large banks through the OCC’s 
supervisory function. The OCC 
formalized these standards in 2014 by 
adopting the Guidelines
2
pursuant to 
section 39 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act.
3
The Guidelines are 
codified in appendix D to the OCC’s 
safety and soundness standards 
regulations in 12 CFR part 30. The 
Guidelines generally establish minimum 
standards for the design and 
implementation of an institution’s risk 
governance framework and set forth 
minimum standards for a board of 
directors (board) in overseeing the risk 
governance framework’s design and 
implementation. 
The Guidelines apply to ‘‘covered 
banks.’’ The term ‘‘covered bank’’ means 
any insured national bank, insured 
Federal savings association, or insured 
Federal branch of a foreign bank with: 
(i) average total consolidated assets 
equal to or greater than $50 billion; (ii) 
average total consolidated assets less 
than $50 billion if that bank’s parent 
company controls at least one covered 
bank; and (iii) average total consolidated 
assets less than $50 billion if the OCC 
determines such bank’s operations are 
highly complex or otherwise present a 
heightened risk.
4
 
The Guidelines provide that a covered 
bank should establish and adhere to a 
formal, written risk governance 
framework that includes well-defined 
risk management roles and 
responsibilities for front line units, 
independent risk management, and 
internal audit, commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘three lines of defense.’’
5
The 
Guidelines indicate that a covered bank 
should have a comprehensive written 
statement that articulates the bank’s risk 
appetite and serves as a basis for the risk 
governance framework.
6
The Guidelines 
also address, in part, concentration and 
front line unit risk limits,
7
processes 
governing risk limit breaches,
8
risk data 
aggregation and reporting,

5.22 (addressing Federal savings association charter 
and bylaws); 12 CFR 7.2000 (addressing national 
bank corporate governance); 12 CFR 7.2008

CFR 7.2010 (addressing national bank directors’ 
responsibilities); 12 CFR part 30, appendix A; 12 
CFR 163.33 (addressing board composition 
requirements for Federal savings associations). See 
also Comptroller of the Currency, Director’s Book: Role of Directors for National Banks and Federal 
Savings Associations (2020). The OCC also 
understands that bank holding company regulations 
and guidance address or further incentivize 
appropriate corporate governance protocols at the 
holding company. See 12 CFR 252.33 (establishing risk management and risk committee corporate 
governance requirements for bank holding 
companies subject to enhanced prudential 
standards); Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, Supervisory Guidance on Board of 
Directors’ Effectiveness, SR Letter 21–3 (Feb. 26, 
2021). See also The Clearing House, Annex A: U.S. Bank Regulatory Related Matters to be Addressed 
by the Board or Board Committee Pursuant to 
Statute, Regulation or Agency Guidance (May 
2016). 
26
The OCC initially considered increasing the 
average total consolidated assets threshold to $500 
billion. The OCC ultimately determined to propose 
increasing this threshold to $700 billion to align 
with the OCC, Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, and Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System’s recent joint final rule entitled 
Regulatory Capital Rule: Modifications to the 
Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards 
for U.S. Global Systemically Important Bank 
Holding Companies and Their Subsidiary 
Depository Institutions; Total Loss-Absorbing 
Capacity and Long-Term Debt Requirements for 
U.S. Global Systemically Important Bank Holding 
Companies. 90 FR 55248 (Dec. 1, 2025). This final 
rule applies, in part, to OCC-supervised national 
banks and Federal savings associations that are 
subsidiaries of bank holding companies with at 
least $700 billion in total consolidated assets or at 
least $10 trillion in assets under custody. 
27
See 12 CFR part 30, appendix D, at I.C. 28
79 FR 54518, 54522 (Sept. 11, 2014) (quoting 
Thomas J. Curry, Comptroller of the Currency, 
Address at the American Bankers Association Risk 
Management Forum (Apr. 10, 2014)). In addition, 
the OCC reiterates that it does not intend to exercise 
the reservation of authority to apply the Guidelines 
to community banks. Id. 
29
As discussed later in this SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATION, an institution with average total 
consolidated assets less than $700 billion would 
continue to be subject to the Guidelines if: (i) its 
parent company controls at least one covered bank; 
or (ii) the OCC determines such bank’s operations 
are highly complex or otherwise present a 
heightened risk. This approach is consistent with 
the current regulation. See 12 CFR part 30, appendix D, at I.E.5. 
management processes,
10
and 
compensation and performance 
management programs.
11
Finally, the 
Guidelines set forth standards for a 
covered bank’s board. These standards 
provide, in part, that the board should 
provide active oversight of 
management,
12
exercise sound, 
independent judgment,
13
and include at 
least two independent directors.
14
 
The OCC recognizes that the 
Guidelines, as currently formulated, 
establish prescriptive standards for 
banking organizations. For instance, the 
Guidelines articulate highly specific 
roles and responsibilities for front line 
units, independent risk management, 
and internal audit. These include, for 
example, provisions that: (i) specify 
when independent risk management 
should convey material risks and 
noncompliance with the risk 
governance framework to the Chief 
Executive Officer, the board, or the 
board’s risk committee;
15
(ii) address 
processes for front line units and 
independent risk management regarding 
risk limit breaches, including when and 
how to inform internal stakeholders and 
the OCC of such breaches as well as the 
content of those communications;
16
and 
(iii) prescribe internal audit 
documentation and reporting standards 
and specify the content for those 
reports.
17
The Guidelines also establish 
detailed standards for the Chief 
Executive Officer with respect to the 
development and content of the 
strategic plan.
18
 
The prescriptiveness of the 
Guidelines is also apparent in the 
standards that they establish for the 
board. For instance, the Guidelines 
impose certain standards on boards 
related to ‘‘credible challenge,’’
19
 
ongoing training programs,
20
and 
annual self-assessments.
21
The 
Guidelines further contemplate an 
expansive administrative role for the 
board. For example, the Guidelines 
provide, in part, that the board or a 
committee thereof should: (i) approve 
the risk governance framework and any 
significant changes to that framework;
22
 
(ii) review and approve the risk appetite 
statement;
23
and (iii) review and 
approve a talent management 
program.
24
There are other laws and 
regulations that address and incentivize 
covered banks and their boards to 
implement and adhere to appropriate 
corporate governance processes and 
procedures.
25
 
Since the Guidelines were adopted in 
2014, the OCC has acquired significant 
experience regarding the burdens and 
benefits of the Guidelines on covered 
banks. Considering the extreme 
prescriptiveness of the Guidelines and 
their associated burden on covered 
banks, the OCC believes that the 
standards may only be justified for the 
largest and most complex institutions as 
their size, complexity, and risk profile 
pose the greatest risk to financial 
stability and the banking system. 
Accordingly, the OCC believes that it is 
appropriate to increase the average total 
consolidated assets threshold for 
applying the Guidelines to covered 
banks from $50 billion to $700 billion 
and requests comment on other 
potential revisions and improvements to 
the Guidelines in light of their 
prescriptive and burdensome 
approach.
26
The proposal would also 
retain the OCC’s reservation of authority 
to apply the Guidelines, in whole or in 
part, to an institution below the $700 
billion average total consolidated assets 
threshold if the OCC determines such 
bank’s operations are highly complex or 
otherwise present a heightened risk as 
to warrant application of the 
Guidelines.
27
As explained when the 
Guidelines were initially adopted, the 
‘‘OCC expects to utilize this authority 
only if a bank’s operations are highly 
complex relative to its risk-management 
capabilities, and notes that ‘[t]his is a 
high threshold that only will be crossed 
in extraordinary circumstances.’ ’’
28
 
By generally excluding institutions 
with average total consolidated assets 
less than $700 billion (Excluded 
Institutions) from the Guidelines’ 
scope,
29
the proposal would provide 
Excluded Institutions with the ability to 
design and implement a risk governance 
framework that is best suited to their 
banking organization. For example, the 
proposal would permit an Excluded 
Institution to develop a risk governance 
framework that contains employee roles 
and responsibilities tailored to their 
specific firm, lines of business, and 
idiosyncratic risks. This would also 
allow Excluded Institutions’ employees 
to spend more time on executing the 
firm’s strategy while simultaneously

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61087 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules 30
In particular, the OCC notes that this proposal 
does not modify or affect the applicability of the 
safety and soundness standards set forth in 
appendix A to 12 CFR part 30. 
31
See ‘‘Bank Supervision Process’’ booklet of the Comptroller’s Handbook, 30 (Sept. 2019) (‘‘In 
carrying out its mission, the OCC employs an 
ongoing risk-based supervision approach focused 
on evaluating risk, identifying material and 
emerging concerns, and requiring banks to take 
timely corrective action before deficiencies 
compromise their safety and soundness.... The risk-based supervision approach concentrates on 
systemic risks and banks that pose the greatest risk 
to the federal banking system.’’). 
32
90 FR 48835 (Oct. 30, 2025). 
33
See, e.g., A Failure of Supervision: Bank 
Failures and the San Francisco Federal Reserve: 
Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Health Care and 
Financial Services of the H. Comm. on Oversight 
and Accountability, 118th Cong. (2023) (Statement 
of Jeremy R. Newell) (‘‘[M]odern bank supervision 
has forcefully embraced an approach that is 
overwhelmingly focused on examining processes— 
that is, risk management processes, governance 
structures, compliance programs and policies and 
procedures—and not the actual underlying 
financial condition and risks those processes 
ostensibly support.’’) (emphasis in original). 
34
While this proposal would provide an 
Excluded Institution with the ability to design and 
implement a risk governance framework tailored to 
its operations, the OCC notes that an Excluded 
Institution could continue to reference and benefit 
from the standards set forth in the Guidelines as 
appropriate. 
35
With respect to insured Federal branches of 
foreign banks, the OCC reiterates that it would 
apply the Guidelines in a flexible manner to such 
institutions. See 79 FR 54518, 54523 (Sept. 11, 2014). 
36
A subset of these covered banks are not the lead 
covered bank within their respective banking 
organizations. If the OCC combines a lead covered 
bank with its non-lead covered bank affiliate(s), the 
total number of banking organizations subject to the 
Guidelines would decrease from 31 to five. 
37
See, e.g., 12 CFR part 30, appendix D, I.A. 
fulfilling their important risk 
management and compliance 
responsibilities. The OCC emphasizes 
that this proposal would not authorize 
Excluded Institutions to neglect their 
risk management or compliance 
responsibilities, or to operate their firms 
in an unsafe or unsound manner.
30
 
Rather, the OCC expects that Excluded 
Institutions will maintain robust risk 
governance frameworks, risk 
management systems, and processes 
that are tailored to their individual size, 
complexity, and risk profile. 
The OCC also expects that this 
proposal would facilitate innovation 
and development in risk management 
practices by providing Excluded 
Institutions with the latitude to develop 
new ways of managing risk that are 
more efficient and effective. For 
instance, the OCC supports banking 
organization efforts to use new 
technologies and techniques in a safe 
and sound manner to identify and 
manage risks. These innovative 
technologies and techniques may be 
used, for example, to identify suspicious 
or anomalous transactions, facilitate 
textual analysis of consumer complaint 
data, or enhance cybersecurity by 
detecting malicious activity, identifying 
compromised systems, and supporting 
threat mitigation. Excluded Institutions’ 
innovations in risk management have 
the potential to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of their risk 
management efforts, improve employee 
performance, and reduce the cost of 
regulatory compliance, thereby 
providing banking organizations with 
the ability to further optimize their cost 
structure. This would allow Excluded 
Institutions to invest their financial 
resources in other endeavors such as 
product and service development, 
upgrades to information technology 
systems and infrastructure, and 
customer service improvements. 
Similarly, the proposal would 
enhance the effectiveness of Excluded 
Institutions’ boards by allowing them to 
refocus on executing their core 
responsibilities. A board’s core 
responsibilities include, but are not 
limited to, overseeing the execution of 
the firm’s strategy, understanding and 
overseeing the firm’s material risk 
exposures, and exercising effective 
oversight of senior management. Rather 
than expending effort to satisfy the 
Guidelines’ prescriptive standards, the 
proposal would provide Excluded 
Institutions’ boards with more time to 
fulfill their core responsibilities which, 
when executed effectively, promotes 
their firms’ safety and soundness. 
Consistent with the OCC’s risk-based 
supervision approach,
31
this proposal 
would also enable the OCC to enhance 
the efficiency of its operations in at least 
two ways. First, it would allow the OCC 
to reallocate supervisory resources from 
Excluded Institutions to larger, more 
complex institutions that pose 
comparatively greater risk to the 
banking system. Second, consistent with 
the OCC’s recent joint notice of 
proposed rulemaking entitled ‘‘Unsafe 
or Unsound Practices, Matters Requiring 
Attention,’’
32
this proposal would 
enable examiners for Excluded 
Institutions to shift their supervisory 
efforts away from examining operational 
processes and refocus on material 
financial risks that could affect the 
safety and soundness of the institutions 
they supervise.
33
 
The OCC believes that it is critical 
that examiners and institutions 
prioritize material financial risks over 
concerns related to policies, process, 
documentation, and other nonfinancial 
risks. This proposal reflects the OCC’s 
judgment and experience that its 
supervisory resources are best focused 
on practices that are likely to materially 
harm an institution’s financial 
condition, such as risks that are more 
likely than other risks to lead to material 
financial losses, bank failures, and 
instability in the banking system. This 
means that, for Excluded Institutions, 
the OCC will no longer focus on 
assessing a firm’s internal policies, 
processes, or governance practices 
relative to prescriptive standards. 
Rather, the OCC expects Excluded 
Institutions to establish and maintain 
internal policies, processes, or 
governance practices that are best suited 
to their firm and consistent with safety 
and soundness.
34
While the OCC may 
continue to provide guidance to 
Excluded Institutions on best practices 
during the normal course of 
supervision, this proposal makes clear 
that the Guidelines and associated 
supervisory efforts may only be justified 
for the largest and most complex 
institutions that pose the greatest risk to 
financial stability and the banking 
system. Accordingly, the OCC believes 
that it is no longer appropriate to apply 
the prescriptive standards in the 
Guidelines to Excluded Institutions and 
therefore proposes an increase to the 
$50 billion average total consolidated 
assets threshold as set forth below. 
II. Proposed Changes 
Threshold. For the reasons described above, the OCC proposes to increase 
from $50 billion to $700 billion the 
average total consolidated assets 
threshold at which the Guidelines apply 
to covered banks. Specifically, this 
proposal would amend the Guidelines’ 
definition of ‘‘covered bank’’ such that 
the term would mean any insured 
national bank, insured Federal savings 
association, or insured Federal branch 
of a foreign bank: (i) with average total 
consolidated assets equal to or greater 
than $700 billion; (ii) with average total 
consolidated assets less than $700 
billion if that bank’s parent company 
controls at least one covered bank; or 
(iii) with average total consolidated 
assets less than $700 billion if the OCC 
determines such bank’s operations are 
highly complex or otherwise present a 
heightened risk.
35
This change would 
reduce the number of covered banks to 
which the Guidelines apply from 38 
institutions to eight institutions, based 
on the most recent data available.
36
 
Conforming changes would also be 
made to other provisions in the 
Guidelines to replace references to the 
$50 billion threshold with the proposed 
$700 billion threshold.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61088 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules By further distinguishing applicable 
risk governance standards based on size, 
complexity, and risk profile, this 
proposal appropriately recognizes the 
fact that banks with average total 
consolidated assets equal to or greater 
than $50 billion differ in the degree of 
risk they present. Under the proposal, 
the Guidelines’ enhanced risk 
governance standards would continue to 
apply to the largest, most complex 
banking organizations that present the 
greatest risk to financial stability and 
the banking system. The proposal would 
no longer include Excluded Institutions 
within the Guidelines’ scope and would 
provide them with the ability to design 
and implement a risk governance 
framework that is consistent with safety 
and soundness and tailored to their 
individual operations. In addition, this 
proposed change would reduce 
regulatory burden and enable the OCC 
to optimize the deployment of its 
supervisory resources. As set forth 
below, the OCC requests comment on 
other potential revisions and 
improvements to the Guidelines given 
their prescriptive and burdensome 
approach. 
Compliance Date. This proposal 
generally makes five changes to the 
Guidelines’ compliance date provisions. 
First, this proposal clarifies that a 
covered bank with average total 
consolidated assets equal to or greater 
than $700 billion as of the effective date 
should continue to be in compliance 
with the Guidelines on the effective 
date. Second, this proposal clarifies that 
a covered bank with average total 
consolidated assets less than $700 
billion that is a covered bank because its 
parent company controls at least one 
other covered bank as of or subsequent 
to the effective date should be in 
compliance with the Guidelines on the 
same date as the other covered bank. 
Third, the proposal provides that a 
covered bank that becomes subject to 
the Guidelines after the effective date 
because its average total consolidated 
assets subsequently equal or exceed 
$700 billion should comply with the 
Guidelines within eighteen months, 
consistent with the current Guidelines. 
Fourth, the proposal clarifies that a 
banking organization with average total 
consolidated assets equal to or greater 
than $50 billion but less than $700 
billion as of the effective date is not a 
covered bank, provided it does not meet 
the definition of a covered bank, and is 
no longer required to comply with the 
Guidelines on the effective date. Finally, 
the OCC proposes removing outdated 
compliance dates that have already 
passed and/or are no longer applicable 
by virtue of this proposal. 
The OCC also proposes certain 
technical amendments to the 
Guidelines. 
III. Request for Comment 
The OCC invites comment on all 
aspects of the proposed revisions to the 
Guidelines and the following specific 
questions: 
Question 1. In what ways could the 
OCC improve the Guidelines? In 
particular, are there amendments the 
OCC should consider making to the 
Guidelines to enhance the safety and 
soundness of institutions that would 
continue to be ‘‘covered banks’’ under 
the proposal? 
Question 2. Rather than exempting 
Excluded Institutions from the 
Guidelines, are there aspects of the 
Guidelines that should continue to 
apply to these banking organizations? If 
so, what standards or provisions in the 
Guidelines should continue to apply to 
these banking organizations and why? 
Question 3. If there are aspects of the 
Guidelines that should continue to 
apply to Excluded Institutions, should 
the OCC tailor the standards applicable 
to these banking organizations based on 
size? If so: (i) what minimum standards 
or provisions in the Guidelines should 
apply to smaller Excluded Institutions 
and why; and (ii) what standards or 
provisions in the Guidelines, in 
addition to those standards or 
provisions applicable to smaller 
Excluded Institutions, should apply to 
larger Excluded Institutions and why? 
For example, should: (i) smaller 
Excluded Institutions be subject to 
standards addressing the strategic plan; 
risk appetite statement; talent 
management processes; and 
compensation and performance 
management programs; and (ii) larger 
Excluded Institutions be subject to those 
standards identified in (i) plus 
standards addressing concentration and 
front line unit risk limits; risk appetite 
review, monitoring, and communication 
processes; concentration risk 
management; and the relationship of the 
risk appetite statement, concentration 
risk limits, and front line unit risk limits 
to other processes? 
Question 4. For those institutions that 
would continue to be ‘‘covered banks’’ 
under the proposal, are there aspects of 
the Guidelines that should be removed 
or revised to reduce regulatory burden? 
If so, what standards or provisions in 
the Guidelines should be removed or 
revised and why? 
Question 5. Should the OCC rescind 
the Guidelines? If so, why, and, if not, 
why not? If the Guidelines should be 
rescinded, should they be reissued as 
supervisory guidance? If so, why, and, 
if not, why not? Alternatively, should 
the OCC maintain the Guidelines for 
‘‘covered banks’’ and issue principles- 
based supervisory guidance for 
Excluded Institutions? If so, why, and, 
if not, why not? 
Question 6. In what ways could the 
OCC improve the transparency of its 
implementation of the Guidelines? What 
specific steps would institutions that 
would continue to be ‘‘covered banks’’ 
under the proposal find helpful to make 
compliance with the Guidelines more 
efficient? 
Question 7. Are there specific 
standards or provisions in the 
Guidelines that duplicate requirements 
set forth in the Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System’s (FRB) 
Enhanced Prudential Standards codified 
at Regulation YY (12 CFR 252.1 et seq.)? 
If so, should the OCC remove or adjust 
those duplicative standards or 
provisions and why? 
Question 8. If the OCC’s proposed 
amendments to the Guidelines are 
finalized as proposed, how would the 
FRB’s Enhanced Prudential Standards 
continue to affect ‘‘covered banks,’’ if at 
all? 
Question 9. Should the OCC increase 
the Guidelines’ average total 
consolidated assets threshold to $700 
billion? If so, why, and, if not, why not? 
Question 10. Should the OCC 
consider establishing the Guidelines’ 
average total consolidated assets 
threshold at an amount different than 
$700 billion? If so, what amount of 
average total consolidated assets would 
be appropriate and why? For example, 
should the OCC increase the Guidelines’ 
average total consolidated assets 
threshold to $500 billion instead of $700 
billion? 
Question 11. Should the Guidelines 
provide that the average total 
consolidated assets threshold will be 
adjusted to reflect inflation, growth in 
gross domestic product, or some other 
metric? If so, what metric is appropriate 
and how frequently should the average 
total consolidated assets threshold be 
adjusted based on that metric? If not, 
why not? 
Question 12. Should the OCC 
consider a banking organization’s 
average total consolidated assets and 
any additional factors for purposes of 
defining the term ‘‘covered bank’’? If so, 
what additional factors should the OCC 
consider and why? For example, should 
the OCC define the term ‘‘covered 
bank,’’ in part, to mean any bank: (i) 
with average total consolidated assets 
equal to or greater than $700 billion; 
and (ii) that is either not ‘‘well 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:28 Dec 29, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00019 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\30DEP1.SGM 30DEP1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61089 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules capitalized’’ or not ‘‘well managed,’’ as 
those terms are defined in 12 CFR 5.3? 
Alternatively, should the OCC 
provide a conditional exclusion from 
the Guidelines for a ‘‘covered bank’’ that 
applies as long as the bank remains 
‘‘well capitalized’’ and ‘‘well managed,’’ 
as those terms are defined in 12 CFR 
5.3? If so, why, and, if not, why not? 
Question 13. The Guidelines provide, 
in part, that a ‘‘covered bank’’ may use 
its parent company’s risk governance 
framework if the risk profiles of the 
parent company and the covered bank 
are substantially the same. The 
Guidelines explain that a parent 
company’s and covered bank’s risk 
profiles are substantially the same if the 
covered bank’s average total 
consolidated assets represent 95 percent 
or more of the parent company’s average 
total consolidated assets. Should the 
OCC increase, decrease, maintain, or 
remove this 95 percent threshold? If the 
OCC should remove this threshold, 
what criteria should the OCC consider 
in determining whether a covered bank 
may use its parent company’s risk 
governance framework and why? 
Question 14. In what ways could the 
OCC clarify the roles and 
responsibilities established for front line 
units, independent risk management, 
and internal audit? For example, should 
the OCC provide covered banks with 
greater flexibility in designating the 
roles and responsibilities that should be 
performed by each organizational unit? 
If so, why, and, if not, why not? 
Question 15. Should the OCC remove 
or adjust any roles and responsibilities 
for front line units, independent risk 
management, or internal audit? If so, 
what roles and responsibilities should 
be removed or adjusted for these 
organizational units and why? If not, 
why not? 
Question 16. Are the Guidelines’ 
definitions of ‘‘front line unit,’’ 
‘‘independent risk management,’’ and 
‘‘internal audit’’ appropriate or should 
they be further refined? If these 
definitions should be further refined, 
what amendments should the OCC 
make and why? 
Question 17. The Guidelines provide 
that the term ‘‘front line unit’’ does not 
ordinarily include an organizational 
unit or function thereof within a 
covered bank that provides legal 
services to the covered bank. Should the 
OCC revise this provision to clarify that 
the term ‘‘front line unit’’ excludes an 
organizational unit or function thereof 
within a covered bank that provides 
legal services to the covered bank? If so, 
why, and, if not, why not? 
Question 18. Are there other 
organizational units that should be 
expressly excluded from the ‘‘front line 
unit’’ definition? If so, what 
organizational units should be excluded 
and why? If not, why not? 
Question 19. How are front line units, 
independent risk management, and 
internal audit using innovative 
technologies or techniques to satisfy 
their responsibilities under the 
Guidelines? Should the OCC revise the 
Guidelines to take into account these 
organizational units’ use of innovative 
technologies or techniques to perform 
their responsibilities under the 
Guidelines? If so, what changes should 
the OCC make to the Guidelines and 
why? If not, why not? 
Question 20. Should the OCC revise 
the standard providing that independent 
risk management should review and 
update the risk governance framework 
at least annually, and as often as needed 
to address improvements in industry 
risk management practices? If so, why, 
and, if not, why not? Similarly, should 
the OCC revise the standard providing 
that the risk governance framework 
should be independently assessed on an 
annual basis? If so, why, and, if not, 
why not? 
Question 21. The Guidelines provide 
that a covered bank should have a 
comprehensive written risk appetite 
statement that includes both qualitative 
components and quantitative limits. 
Should the OCC revise the provisions 
addressing the risk appetite statement? 
If so, what adjustments should be made 
and why? If not, why not? 
Question 22. Should the OCC revise 
the provisions related to strategic 
planning? If so, what adjustments 
should be made and why? If not, why 
not? For example, should the OCC 
revise the standard providing that the 
strategic plan cover a three-year period? 
Question 23. Do the compensation 
and performance management 
provisions in paragraph II.M. of the 
Guidelines duplicate other statutory or 
regulatory requirements, such as the 
compensation provisions in appendix A 
to 12 CFR part 30? If so, should the OCC 
remove or adjust paragraph II.M. of the 
Guidelines and why? If not, why not? 
Question 24. In various provisions, 
the Guidelines generally refer to 
applicable policies, procedures, and/or 
processes. Should the OCC revise the 
Guidelines to focus on applicable 
policies, and remove references to 
procedures and processes? If so, why, 
and, if not, why not? 
Question 25. In what ways could the 
OCC improve the Guidelines with 
respect to the standards established for 
boards of directors in section III of the 
Guidelines? Are there board standards 
currently contained in the Guidelines 
that should be removed or adjusted? If 
so, what standards should be removed 
or adjusted and why? For example, 
should the OCC remove or further refine 
paragraph III.B. of the Guidelines, 
addressing ‘‘credible challenge,’’ or 
paragraph III.C. of the Guidelines, 
providing that each member of the 
board should exercise sound, 
independent judgment? If so, why, and, 
if not, why not? 
Question 26. Paragraph III.B. of the 
Guidelines provides, in part, that the 
board may rely on risk assessments and 
reports prepared by independent risk 
management and internal audit to 
support the board’s ability to question, 
challenge, and when necessary, oppose 
recommendations and decisions made 
by management that could cause the 
covered bank’s risk profile to exceed its 
risk appetite or jeopardize the safety and 
soundness of the covered bank. Should 
the OCC revise this paragraph to clarify 
that the board may rely on risk 
assessments and reports prepared by 
front line units, in addition to 
independent risk management and 
internal audit? If so, why, and, if not, 
why not? 
Question 27. The Guidelines provide 
that at least two members of the board 
should be independent directors. 
Should the OCC increase or decrease the 
number of independent directors set 
forth in the Guidelines, maintain the 
current standard, or remove this 
standard? Alternatively, should the 
Guidelines provide that a certain 
percentage of the board, for example 25 
percent, consist of independent 
directors? If so, what percentage would 
be appropriate and why? If not, why 
not? 
Question 28. If the chairperson of a 
covered bank’s board is a non- 
independent director, should the 
Guidelines provide that the 
independent directors designate, among 
themselves, a lead independent 
director? If so, why and what roles and 
responsibilities should the lead 
independent director have under the 
Guidelines? If not, why not? 
Question 29. Aside from the 
Guidelines’ standards for boards of 
directors set forth in section III of the 
Guidelines, are there other 
responsibilities placed upon the board 
or board committees in the Guidelines 
that should be removed or adjusted? If 
so, what responsibilities should be 
removed or adjusted and why? For 
example, rather than providing that the 
full board should evaluate and approve 
the strategic plan, should the OCC 
revise paragraph II.D. of the Guidelines 
to provide that the board or a committee 
thereof should perform this

responsibility? Similarly, should the 
Guidelines continue to provide that 
evaluation and approval of the strategic 
plan occur on an annual basis? If so, 
why, and, if not, why not? 
Question 30. Paragraph II.L.2. of the 
Guidelines provides, in part, that the 
board or a committee thereof should 
review and approve a talent 
management program that provides for 
succession planning regarding the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Audit 
Executive, and one or more Chief Risk 
Executives, their direct reports, and 
other potential successors. Should the 
OCC revise this paragraph to provide 
that the board or a committee thereof 
should review and approve a talent 
management program that provides for 
succession planning only for the Chief 
Executive Officer, Chief Audit 
Executive, and one or more Chief Risk 
Executives? If so, why, and, if not, why 
not? 
Question 31. Paragraph II.J.2. of the 
Guidelines provides, in part, that a 
covered bank’s policies, procedures, and 
processes should provide for the 
reporting of material risks, 
concentrations, and emerging risks in a 
timely manner to the board. Should the 
OCC revise this paragraph to provide 
that the reporting of material risks, 
concentrations, and emerging risks may 
be made to the board or the board’s risk 
committee? If so, why, and, if not, why 
not? 
Question 32. Are there 
responsibilities placed upon the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) in the 
Guidelines that should be removed or 
adjusted? If so, what responsibilities 
should be removed or adjusted and 
why? 
IV. Administrative Law Matters 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (PRA),
38
the OCC may not 
conduct or sponsor, and a respondent is 
not required to respond to, an 
information collection unless it displays 
a currently valid Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) control number. This 
notice of proposed rulemaking includes 
changes to an approved collection of 
information pursuant to the provisions 
of the PRA. The OCC submitted the 
information collections contained in 
this notice of proposed rulemaking to 
OMB for review and approval, under 
section 3507(d) of the PRA and section 
1320.11 of OMB’s implementing 
regulations (5 CFR part 1320). 
The Guidelines contain recordkeeping 
requirements previously approved by 
OMB, which are found in 12 CFR part 
30, appendix D. Appendix D establishes 
minimum standards for the design and 
implementation of a risk governance 
framework and minimum standards for 
a board in providing oversight of the 
framework’s design and 
implementation. Appendix D also 
addresses, in part, the responsibilities of 
front line units, independent risk 
management, and internal audit, as well 
as banks’ strategic plan, risk appetite 
statement, concentration and front line 
unit risk limits, risk limit breaches, risk 
data aggregation and reporting, talent 
management processes, and 
compensation and performance 
management programs. Standards for 
the board include training and annual 
self-assessments. 
Under the proposal, the threshold for 
applying the Guidelines to a bank 
would be increased from $50 billion to 
$700 billion in average total 
consolidated assets. The proposal would 
implement this change by modifying the 
Guidelines’ definition of ‘‘covered 
bank.’’ Under this revised definition, the 
term ‘‘covered bank’’ would mean any 
insured national bank, insured Federal 
savings association, or insured Federal 
branch of a foreign bank: (i) with 
average total consolidated assets equal 
to or greater than $700 billion; (ii) with 
average total consolidated assets less 
than $700 billion if that bank’s parent 
company controls at least one covered 
bank; or (iii) with average total 
consolidated assets less than $700 
billion if the OCC determines such 
bank’s operations are highly complex or 
otherwise present a heightened risk. The 
proposed revisions would revise the 
number of respondents required to 
comply with the Guidelines’ 
recordkeeping requirements. 
The following revised information 
collection was submitted to OMB for 
review. 
Title: OCC Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large 
Insured National Banks, Insured Federal 
Savings Associations, and Insured 
Federal Branches; Technical 
Amendments. 
OMB Control No.: 1557–0321. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit organizations. 
Estimated Burden: 
Frequency of Response: On occasion. 
Total Number of Respondents: 8. 
Total Burden per Respondent: 3,776 
hours. 
Total Burden for Collection: 30,208 
hours. 
Comments are invited on: 
(a) Whether the collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
OCC, including whether the information 
has practical utility; 
(b) The accuracy of the OCC’s 
estimate of the burden of the collection 
of information; 
(c) Ways to enhance the quality, 
utility, and clarity of the information to 
be collected; 
(d) Ways to minimize the burden of 
the collection on respondents, including 
through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information 
technology; and 
(e) Estimates of capital or start-up 
costs and costs of operation, 
maintenance, and purchase of services 
to provide information. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA)
39
requires an agency, in 
connection with a proposed rule, to 
prepare an Initial Regulatory Flexibility 
Analysis describing the impact of the 
rule on small entities (defined by the 
U.S. Small Business Administration 
(SBA) for purposes of the RFA to 
include commercial banks and savings 
institutions with total assets of $850 
million or less and trust companies with 
total assets of $47 million or less). 
However, under section 605(b) of the 
RFA, this analysis is not required if an 
agency certifies that the proposed rule 
would not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities and publishes its certification 
and a short explanatory statement in the 
Federal Register along with its 
proposed rule. 
For these reasons, the OCC certifies 
that this regulation, if adopted, will not 
have a significant economic impact on 
a substantial number of small entities. 
Accordingly, an initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis is not required. The 
OCC currently supervises 609 small 
entities based on the SBA’s definition of 
small entities for RFA purposes. As 
discussed in the 
SUPPLEMENTARY 
INFORMATIONabove, the Guidelines 
currently apply to any insured national 
bank, insured Federal savings 
association, or insured Federal branch 
of a foreign bank: (i) with average total 
consolidated assets equal to or greater 
than $50 billion; (ii) with average total 
consolidated assets less than $50 billion 
if that bank’s parent company controls 
at least one covered bank; or (iii) with 
average total consolidated assets less 
than $50 billion if the OCC determines 
such bank’s operations are highly 
complex or otherwise present a 
heightened risk. This proposal would 
increase the average total consolidated 
assets threshold to $700 billion and,

44
As previously noted, the proposed $700 billion 
threshold is intended to align with the OCC, 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and FRB’s 
recent joint final rule addressing the enhanced 
supplementary leverage ratio. See supra note 26. 
45
As previously discussed, the proposal would 
reduce the number of ‘‘covered banks’’ to which the 
Guidelines apply from 38 institutions to eight 
institutions, based on the most recent data 
available. A subset of covered banks are not the lead 
covered bank within their respective banking 
organizations. If the OCC combines a lead covered 
bank with its non-lead covered bank affiliate(s), the 
total number of banking organizations subject to the 
Guidelines would decrease from 31 to five. The 
OCC’s analysis under Executive Order 12866 
assesses the cost savings that would result based on 
the number of banking organizations subject to the 
Guidelines decreasing from 31 to five because that 
approach is more conservative and reflects the fact 
that a non-lead covered bank may utilize aspects of 
its lead covered bank’s risk governance framework. 
therefore, will not affect any small 
entities using the SBA’s definition of 
small entities for RFA purposes. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
The OCC has analyzed the proposed 
rule under the factors in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(UMRA).
40
Under this analysis, the OCC 
considered whether the proposed rule 
includes a Federal mandate that may 
result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
or by the private sector, of $100 million 
or more in any one year ($187 million 
as adjusted annually for inflation). 
Pursuant to section 202 of the UMRA,
41
 
if a proposed rule meets this UMRA 
threshold the OCC would need to 
prepare a written statement that 
includes, among other things, a cost- 
benefit analysis of the proposal. 
The OCC estimates that this proposal 
would not require additional 
expenditures from OCC-regulated 
institutions. As discussed in the 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONabove, this 
proposal would likely result in a 
decrease in banking organization 
expenditures because it would remove 
compliance mandates for institutions 
excluded from the Guidelines’ scope, 
thereby resulting in cost savings. 
Therefore, the OCC finds that the 
proposed rule does not trigger the 
UMRA cost threshold. Accordingly, the 
OCC has not prepared the written 
statement described in section 202 of 
the UMRA. 
Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
Pursuant to section 302(a) of the 
Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994,
42
 
in determining the effective date and 
administrative compliance requirements 
for new regulations that impose 
additional reporting, disclosure, or other 
requirements on insured depository 
institutions, the OCC must consider, 
consistent with the principles of safety 
and soundness and the public interest: 
(i) any administrative burdens that the 
proposed rule would place on 
depository institutions, including small 
depository institutions, and customers 
of depository institutions; and (ii) the 
benefits of the proposed rule. This 
rulemaking would not impose 
additional reporting, disclosure, or other 
requirements on insured depository 
institutions. Therefore, section 302(a) of 
the Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
does not apply to this rulemaking. 
Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability 
Through Transparency Act of 2023
43
 
requires that a notice of proposed 
rulemaking include the internet address 
of a summary of not more than 100 
words in length of a proposed rule, in 
plain language, that shall be posted on 
the internet website 
www.regulations.gov. 
The OCC is proposing to amend its 
Guidelines relating to heightened 
standards for insured national banks, 
insured Federal savings associations, 
and insured Federal branches to 
increase the average total consolidated 
assets threshold for applying the 
Guidelines from $50 billion to $700 
billion. In addition, the proposal would 
clarify certain compliance dates and 
make other technical amendments. 
The proposal and the required 
summary can be found at https:// 
www.regulations.gov by searching for Docket ID OCC–2025–0207 and https:// 
occ.gov/topics/laws-and-regulations/ 
occ-regulations/proposed-issuances/ 
index-proposed-issuances.html. 
Executive Order 12866 (as Amended) 
Executive Order 12866, entitled 
‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review,’’ as 
amended, requires the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA), Office of Management and 
Budget to determine whether a 
proposed rule is a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ prior to the 
disclosure of the proposed rule to the 
public. If OIRA finds the proposed rule 
to be a ‘‘significant regulatory action,’’ 
Executive Order 12866 requires the OCC 
to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the 
proposed rule and for OIRA to conduct 
a review of the proposed rule prior to 
publication in the Federal Register. 
Executive Order 12866 defines 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ to mean 
a regulatory action that is likely to (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more or adversely 
affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or State, local, 
or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in Executive 
Order 12866. 
OIRA has determined that this 
proposed rule is an economically 
significant regulatory action under 
section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 
and, therefore, was subject to review 
under Executive Order 12866. The 
OCC’s analysis conducted in connection 
with Executive Order 12866 is available 
at www.regulations.gov and summarized herein. 
This proposed rule would apply to 
any insured national bank, insured 
Federal savings association, or insured 
Federal branch of a foreign bank: (i) 
with average total consolidated assets 
equal to or greater than $700 billion; (ii) 
with average total consolidated assets 
less than $700 billion if that bank’s 
parent company controls at least one 
covered bank; or (iii) with average total 
consolidated assets less than $700 
billion if the OCC determines such 
bank’s operations are highly complex or 
otherwise present a heightened risk.
44
 
The OCC’s analysis under Executive 
Order 12866 assesses the cost savings 
that would result if the total number of 
banking organizations subject to the 
Guidelines were to decrease from 31 to 
five.
45
 
The most probable cost savings for 
Excluded Institutions may result from 
staffing reductions that reduce 
duplicative roles and responsibilities. 
For example, Excluded Institutions may 
consider streamlining their staffs’ roles 
and responsibilities as they may have 
established redundant risk management 
processes across lines of defense. While 
Excluded Institutions’ efforts to seek 
greater operational efficiencies may 
result in staff reductions, the OCC notes 
that this outcome likely depends on 
idiosyncratic, institution-specific 
characteristics. For example, some 
Excluded Institutions, such as those

The estimated annual time savings of 3,776 
hours is based on the OCC’s analysis when the 
Guidelines were adopted in 2014. 
47
To estimate hourly wages, the OCC reviewed 
data from May 2024 for wages (by industry and 
occupation) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS) for depository credit intermediation (NAICS 
522100). To estimate compensation costs associated 
with the Guidelines, the OCC uses $131 per hour, 
which is based on the average of the 90th percentile 
for the occupations reported annually by the BLS 
plus an additional 38 percent to cover inflation 
(equal to 3.6% in the first quarter of 2025) and 
private sector benefits. According to the BLS’s 
employer costs of employee benefits data, 36 
percent represents the average private sector costs 
of employee benefits. While vastly below the hourly 
wage of a chief executive officer or a director of an 
institution subject to the proposed rule, the OCC 
uses the $131 hourly wage for all hours under the 
assumption that subordinate employees will 
perform much of the preparatory work. 
48
See supra note 25. 
closer to the proposed $700 billion 
average total consolidated assets 
threshold, may not make any changes to 
their staffing levels. Accordingly, the 
OCC’s analysis indicates a lower and 
upper bound of potential cost savings 
associated with staffing reductions of 
approximately $0 (assuming Excluded 
Institutions make no staffing changes) 
and $220 million (assuming all 
Excluded Institutions reduce staff by 20 
percent), respectively. 
In addition to potential staff 
reductions, Excluded Institutions may 
also experience time savings benefits 
associated with personnel that no longer 
devote time to complying with the 
Guidelines. The OCC estimates annual 
time savings of approximately 3,776 
hours per Excluded Institution.
46
This 
would result in 2025 inflation-adjusted 
cost savings of $494,656 per Excluded 
Institution,
47
or approximately $12.8 
million across all Excluded Institutions. 
There may also be indirect savings 
and indirect costs associated with the 
proposal. With respect to indirect 
savings, increasing the average total 
consolidated assets threshold as 
proposed may, on the margin, affect 
institutions’ strategic asset size 
decisions. However, any cost savings 
associated with this potential 
development may be minimal and the 
net impact is uncertain. With respect to 
indirect costs, increasing the average 
total consolidated assets threshold 
could lead Excluded Institutions to 
devote fewer resources to maintaining 
adequate risk governance and risk 
management practices. However, this 
risk should be low because the proposal 
does not modify the OCC’s supervisory 
oversight or standards
48
nor does it 
suggest that Excluded Institutions 
would change their risk appetite, asset 
allocation, or asset growth decisions. In 
addition, as previously discussed in this 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, the OCC 
emphasizes that this proposal would not 
authorize Excluded Institutions to 
neglect their risk management or 
compliance responsibilities, or to 
operate their firms in an unsafe or 
unsound manner. Rather, the OCC 
expects that Excluded Institutions will 
maintain robust risk governance 
frameworks, risk management systems, 
and processes that are tailored to their 
individual size, complexity, and risk 
profile. Therefore, the OCC does not 
expect that the proposal would 
adversely impact the adequacy and 
comprehensiveness of Excluded 
Institutions’ risk governance and risk 
management practices. 
The OCC’s analysis indicates a lower 
and upper bound of aggregate potential 
cost savings from expected staff 
reductions and time savings of 
approximately $13 million and $233 
million, respectively. The OCC 
estimated a range of potential outcomes 
based on different approaches and 
operational and strategic decisions by 
institutions. For example, the OCC’s 
analysis indicates aggregate cost savings 
from both expected staff reductions and 
time savings ranging from $54 million to 
$123 million, using an assumption of a 
10 percent staff reduction. The OCC 
preliminarily concludes that the most 
plausible outcome is a 10 percent staff 
reduction with the assumption that the 
three largest banks not subject to the 
Guidelines would not change their 
behavior. In this scenario, the potential 
cost savings from both expected staff 
reductions and time savings would 
amount to approximately $67 million. 
There are no explicit mandates in the 
proposal for OCC-supervised 
institutions. Excluded Institutions’ 
operational and strategic decisions will 
ultimately determine the impact of the 
proposal over the long term. 
Executive Order 14192 
Executive Order 14192, entitled 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’ requires that an agency, 
unless prohibited by law, identify at 
least ten existing regulations to be 
repealed when the agency publicly 
proposes for notice and comment or 
otherwise promulgates a new regulation 
with total costs greater than zero. 
Executive Order 14192 further requires 
that new incremental costs associated 
with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated 
with at least ten prior regulations. The 
OCC expects the proposed rule as 
finalized will be a deregulatory action 
under Executive Order 14192 because, 
as explained elsewhere, the final rule 
should have total costs less than zero.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
A. Introduction 
The dual banking system, which is 
‘‘made up of parallel federal and state 
banking systems’’ that ‘‘co-exist and 
compete,’’ is foundational to the 
American financial system.
1
Congress 
designed this system to permit banks to 
choose the charter—state or federal— 
that best fits their business needs and 
allows them to best serve their 
customers. Federal preemption, which 
derives from the Supremacy Clause of 
the U.S. Constitution, has long been 
recognized as fundamental to the design 
of the dual banking system.
2
It removes 
barriers and creates efficiencies 
associated with operating under a 
uniform set of rules, which fosters the 
development of national products and 
services and multi-state markets. As 
such, federal preemption is a critical 
tool for reducing unnecessary burden, 
enabling local and national prosperity, 
and unleashing economic growth. 
Congress has consistently reaffirmed the 
important role that federal preemption 
plays in the dual banking system, 
including by codifying preemption 
standards for OCC-regulated banks as 
part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
(Dodd-Frank)
3
and extending 
comparable federal preemption 
standards to state-chartered banks in 
some cases.
4
 
In addition, the U.S. Department of 
Justice (DOJ) and the National Economic 
Council (NEC) recently recognized the

For purposes of this proposed preemption 
determination, references to the National Bank Act 
generally include 12 U.S.C. 371, which authorizes 
national banks to engage in real estate lending, 
although section 371 is part of the Federal Reserve 
Act. 
9
The analysis in this proposed preemption 
determination focuses on national bank powers and 
preemption of state interest-on-escrow laws by the 
National Bank Act. However, the Home Owners’ 
Loan Act of 1933 (‘‘HOLA’’) directs courts to apply 
‘‘the laws and legal standards applicable to national 
banks’’ in determining whether federal law 
preempts state regulation of Federal savings 
associations. 12 U.S.C. 1465(a). As such, the OCC’s 
analysis is equally applicable to Federal savings 
associations and preemption by the HOLA.

benefits of preemption when they 
solicited public comment on state laws 
that significantly and adversely affect 
the national economy or interstate 
economic activity and solutions to 
address such effects, including whether 
such state laws are preempted by 
existing federal law.
5
This request for 
comment was not limited to banking but 
rather covered state laws that affect all 
parts of the American economy, 
consistent with the role that federal 
preemption plays in many other sectors, 
including energy and aviation. 
Given that federal preemption has 
long been a critical feature of the dual 
banking system, the OCC is well 
positioned to support the 
Administration’s preemption efforts. For 
example, in response to the DOJ and 
NEC request for comment, banking 
industry commenters specifically 
highlighted state laws that eliminate 
banks’ flexibility to decide whether and 
to what extent to pay interest or other 
compensation on funds placed in 
escrow accounts (interest-on-escrow 
laws), observing that these laws could 
cause banks to increase mortgage prices 
or even reduce their mortgage lending.
6
 
State interest-on-escrow laws may also 
eliminate banks’ flexibility to assess 
related fees. The question of whether 
federal law preempts state interest-on- 
escrow laws has been extensively 
litigated. However, while multiple 
circuits and even the Supreme Court 
have considered this issue,
7
there 
remains substantial uncertainty. 
Moreover, this litigation has introduced 
ambiguity regarding how to evaluate 
National Bank Act preemption 
generally. 
To provide much needed clarity, the 
OCC is proposing to issue a preemption 
determination addressing state interest- 
on-escrow laws. Specifically, this 
preemption determination would 
conclude that (1) the National Bank 
Act
8
preempts New York’s Gen. Oblig. 
Law section 5–601, the state’s interest- 
on-escrow law; (2) eleven other states 
have laws with substantively equivalent 
terms; and (3) these substantively 
equivalent state laws are also 
preempted.
9
This proposed preemption 
determination would complement the 
OCC’s notice of proposed rulemaking to 
codify national banks’ longstanding 
escrow accounts power, which the 
agency is concurrently issuing.
10
As 
discussed below, if that concurrent 
rulemaking is finalized, state interest- 
on-escrow laws would directly conflict 
with the federal power addressed 
therein and would thus be preempted. 
B. New York Interest-on-Escrow Law 
New York’s Gen. Oblig. Law section 
5–601 requires ‘‘mortgage investing 
institutions’’ to pay ‘‘dividends or 
interest at a rate of not less than two per 
centum per year . . . or a rate 
prescribed by the [New York] 
superintendent of financial services’’ on 
escrow account balances. This statutory 
obligation applies whenever the 
institution ‘‘maintains an escrow 
account pursuant to any agreement 
executed in connection with a mortgage 
on any one to six family residence 
occupied by the owner or on any 
property owned by a cooperative 
apartment corporation’’ located in New 
York.
11
This New York law also requires 
the institution to credit the interest to 
the escrow account on a quarterly basis, 
and it generally prohibits the 
assessment of a service charge in 
connection with maintaining an escrow 
account.
12
Accordingly, this New York 
interest-on-escrow law purports to 
require national banks to pay a specific 
amount of interest on funds placed in an 
escrow account maintained in 
connection with a covered mortgage and 
to prohibit them from charging related 
fees except in limited circumstances. 
C. Standard for National Bank Act 
Preemption 
The U.S. Constitution provides that 
federal law is the supreme law of the 
land and contrary state law is 
preempted.
13
In applying this principle, 
the Supreme Court has identified 
several ways in which federal law may 
preempt state law, including when there 
is a conflict.
14
In Barnett Bank v. Nelson, the Supreme Court clarified the standard for conflict preemption in the 
national banking context, holding that 
state law is preempted when it prevents 
or significantly interferes with a 
national bank’s exercise of its federal 
powers.
15
The Barnett Court also stated that federal grants of authority in the 
national banking context are ‘‘not 
normally limited by, but rather 
ordinarily pre-empt[ ], contrary state 
law.’’
16
 
In 2024, in Cantero v. Bank of America, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Barnett standard and explained that its application must be based on ‘‘a 
practical assessment of the nature and 
degree of the interference caused by a 
state law.’’
17
This assessment may 
include consideration of Barnett and its antecedents and be based on ‘‘the text 
and structure of the laws, comparison to 
other precedents, and common 
sense.’’
18
In addition to Barnett, the Cantero Court specifically discussed six antecedent cases, noting that they 
‘‘furnish content’’ regarding the Barnett 
standard for conflict preemption in the 
banking context.
19
 
In Barnett, the Supreme Court evaluated whether the National Bank 
Act preempted a Florida law that 
prohibited national banks from selling 
insurance. Federal law permitted, but 
did not require, national banks to sell 
insurance in small towns. Holding that 
this authority vested national banks 
with ‘‘a broad, not a limited’’ power and 
was ‘‘without relevant qualification,’’ 
the Court concluded that the federal law 
preempted the state law.

state laws, such as those that interfere with 
flexibility that federal law specifically grants to 
banks, can create an ‘‘obvious’’ or direct conflict 
that results in preemption. Conti, 157 F.4th at 17– 18. 
33
A state consumer financial law is ‘‘a State law 
that does not directly or indirectly discriminate 
against national banks and that directly and 
specifically regulates the manner, content, or terms 
and conditions of any financial transaction (as may 
be authorized for national banks to engage in), or 
any account related thereto, with respect to a 
consumer.’’ 12 U.S.C. 25b(a)(2). 
34
See Cantero, 602 U.S. at 213 (noting that Dodd- 
Frank established the controlling preemption 
standard for state consumer financial laws ‘‘like 
New York’s interest-on-escrow law’’). 
35
This codification did not create a new standard 
but rather incorporated the conflict preemption 
standard reflected in Barnett. Id. at 214 n.2 (‘‘Dodd- 
Frank adopted Barnett Bank, and . . . Barnett Bank 
was also the governing preemption standard before 
Dodd-Frank.’’). See also OCC Interpretive Letter 1173, December 18, 2020; Office of Thrift 
Supervision Integration; Dodd-Frank Act 
Implementation, 76 FR 43549, 43555 (July 21, 2011). Section 25b also includes two other 
preemption standards for State consumer financial 
laws—when the state law has a discriminatory 
effect and when it is preempted by other federal law 
(including 12 U.S.C. 371). 12 U.S.C. 25b(b)(1)(A) 
and (C). 
36
A ‘‘preemption determination’’ refers to an 
OCC regulation or order that concludes that a state 
consumer financial law is preempted in accordance 
with the Barnett standard under section 25b(b)(1)(B). 
37
Dodd-Frank also requires the OCC to (1) 
publish a list of preemption determinations then in 
effect at least quarterly; and (2) conduct periodic 
reviews of each determination that federal law 
preempts a state consumer financial law. Should 
the OCC decide to finalize this preemption 
determination, the OCC will comply with these 
requirements at the appropriate time. In addition, 
12 U.S.C. 43 imposes procedural requirements on 
the OCC when it takes certain preemption actions, 
including requiring the OCC to provide notice of 
the issue in the Federal Register and give interested 
parties at least 30 days to submit written comments.

Davis v. Elmira Sav. Bank, 161 U.S. 275, 283 (1896). 
law that limited when a Federal savings 
and loan association could exercise a 
due-on-sale clause. A federal regulation 
recognized the power of Federal savings 
and loans to include these clauses in 
mortgage contracts and specifically 
provided these institutions with the 
flexibility to decide when to exercise 
them. Finding that the state law 
limitations would interfere with this 
flexibility, which was critical to the 
federal scheme, the Fidelity Court concluded that the state law was 
preempted.
21
 
In Franklin National Bank of Franklin Square v. New York, the Supreme Court considered a New York law that 
prohibited banks from using the word 
‘‘saving’’ or its variants in advertising 
and business.
22
Federal law granted 
national banks the power to accept 
savings deposits and advertise this 
power. Because the state law interfered 
with national banks’ ability to exercise 
these powers ‘‘effectively’’ and 
‘‘efficiently,’’ it was preempted.
23
 
In First National Bank of San Jose v. California, the Supreme Court considered a California dormant 
account law that included an expedited 
process for escheating deposits to the 
state. The Court found that the state law 
qualified national banks’ deposit-taking 
authority in an ‘‘unusual’’ way. As such, 
the Court held that the state law was 
preempted.
24
 
The Supreme Court has also 
recognized that when a state law does 
not prevent or significantly interfere 
with the national bank’s exercise of its 
powers, it is not preempted.
25
For 
example, in Anderson National Bank v. 
Luckett, the Supreme Court contrasted California’s dormant account law 
addressed in San Jose with a more 
conventional dormant account law in 
Kentucky. The Supreme Court found 
that the Kentucky law was not 
preempted, including because it applied 
a rule that was ‘‘old as the common law 
itself.’’
26
The Anderson Supreme Court noted that the state law addressed the 
transfer and devolution of property in 
the state,
27
a kind of generally 
applicable state ‘infrastructure’ law that 
is typically not preempted.
28
 
In McClellan v. Chipman, the Supreme Court considered a 
Massachusetts law that prohibited 
certain transfers of property. The Court’s 
decision recognized that national banks 
are subject to general state laws in their 
‘‘dealings and contracts,’’ unless those 
laws expressly conflict with federal law, 
frustrate the purpose of national banks, 
or impair their efficiency. Finding that 
the Massachusetts law was generally 
applicable and national banks were 
subject to no greater conditions and 
restrictions than other Massachusetts 
citizens, the McClellan Court held that the state law was not preempted.
29
 
Similarly, in First National Bank v. 
Commonwealth of Kentucky, the 
Supreme Court held that a Kentucky tax 
law was not preempted, noting that 
national banks are generally subject to 
state laws on contracts, the acquisition 
and transfer of property, and the right to 
collect and be sued for debts.
30
 
While the Supreme Court precedent 
discussed above does ‘‘not purport to 
establish a clear line to demarcate’’ 
which state laws are and are not 
preempted by federal law, they offer a 
lens through which the standard comes 
into focus.
31
Specifically, these cases 
demonstrate that a state law prevents or 
significantly interferes with a federal 
power, at a minimum, when it interferes 
with critical flexibility granted to a 
national bank under federal law,
32
 
interferes with a national bank’s 
efficiency and effectiveness in 
exercising its federal power, or qualifies 
a federal power in an unusual way. In 
contrast, as discussed above, generally 
applicable infrastructure laws typically 
apply to national banks. 
D. 12 U.S.C. 25b and State Consumer 
Financial Laws 
As part of Dodd-Frank, Congress 
addressed National Bank Act 
preemption, primarily with respect to 
‘‘State consumer financial laws,’’
33
such 
as state interest-on-escrow laws.
34
In 
particular, section 25b codified the 
Barnett standard,35
expressly recognized 
the OCC’s role in preemption, and 
established procedural requirements for 
OCC ‘‘preemption determinations.’’
36
 
Specifically, Dodd-Frank provides 
that the OCC may issue a preemption 
determination by regulation or order on 
a case-by-case basis, which means that 
the determination may address the 
impact of (1) a particular state consumer 
financial law; and (2) the law of any 
other state with substantively equivalent 
terms. When making a determination 
that the law of another state has 
substantively equivalent terms, the OCC 
must first consult with the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and 
take its views into account. In addition, 
Dodd-Frank requires that the 
preemption determination be supported 
by ‘‘substantial evidence, made on the 
record of the proceeding.’’

12 U.S.C. 371. Congress has progressively

on farm land (Pub. L. 63–43, ch. 6, § 24, 38 Stat. 
251, 273 (Dec. 23, 1913)), Congress amended the 
law to include limited general real estate lending 
in 1916 (Pub. L. 64–270, ch. 461, 39 Stat. 752, 754 
(Sept. 7, 1916)), and has through the years removed 
all limits and conditions on real estate lending 
(Pub. L. 97–320, Title IV, § 403(a), 96 Stat. 1469, 
1510–11 (Oct. 15, 1982)), other than those 
prescribed in regulation by the Comptroller.

regarding the OCC’s proposed preemption 
determination herein, the OCC assumes that its 
concurrently proposed rulemaking will be finalized

two proposals concurrently provides the public 
with more complete information, which will 
improve its opportunity to comment. The OCC will

light of any changes to the concurrently proposed 
rule, including based on the comments it receives, 
if and when that rule is finalized.

Conti, 157 F.4th at 17–18 (categorizing each of these as creating a direct or obvious conflict). 
Moreover, New York’s interest-on-escrow law is not 
analogous to the cases where the Court did not find 
preemption: Anderson, Commonwealth, and McClellan. As discussed above, these cases focus on state laws of general applicability. Accordingly, 
these cases have limited relevance to state interest- 
on-escrow laws. See Conti, 157 F.4th at 20

‘‘banking-specific’’).

and treat customers fairly.
39
 
Real estate lending has been core to 
the business of national banks for over 
100 years. Congress has specifically 
authorized national banks to ‘‘make, 
arrange, purchase or sell loans or 
extensions of credit secured by liens on 
interests in real estate, subject to . . . 
such restrictions and requirements as 
the Comptroller of the Currency may 
prescribe by regulation or order.’’
40
 
Frequently, national banks offer or 
require borrowers to establish escrow 
accounts when they make real estate 
loans. These escrow accounts serve a 
variety purposes, including protecting 
the priority of the bank’s security 
interest in the property that 
collateralizes the loan and maintaining 
appropriate insurance on the property.
41
 
As such, they are a crucial risk 
mitigation tool that supports safe and 
sound lending. 
The OCC is concurrently proposing a 
regulation to codify national bank’s 
authority to establish and maintain 
escrow accounts and to clarify that the 
terms and conditions of any such 
escrow account, including the 
investment of escrowed funds, fees 
assessed for the use of such accounts, or 
whether and to what extent interest or 
other compensation is calculated and 
paid to customers whose funds are 
placed in the escrow account, are 
business decisions to be made by each 
national bank in its discretion.
42
As 
noted in the proposed rule, that 
regulation would codify authority that 
national banks already have under 
federal law. Even in the absence of that 
rule, national banks have the flexibility 
to make informed business decisions 
about how to effectively and efficiently 
set the terms and conditions of their 
escrow accounts. 
Contrary to the flexibility granted by 
federal law as proposed to be codified 
by the OCC, New York’s interest-on- 
escrow law dictates a minimum interest 
national banks must pay on funds held 
in escrow accounts and generally 
prohibits them from assessing related 
service charges, regardless of whether 
paying this interest or assessing such 
charges is consistent with the bank’s 
business judgment. As such, the nature 
and degree of interference caused by the 
New York interest-on-escrow law is 
‘‘more akin’’ to the interference 
identified in at least three of the 
antecedent cases where the Court found 
preemption: Barnett, Franklin, and Fidelity.
43
 
Fidelity is particularly apt. In that case, a federal regulation provided each 
Federal savings and loan association 
with authority to exercise contractual 
due-on-sale clauses ‘‘at its option’’ and 
stated that the exercise of such option 
was ‘‘exclusively governed by the terms 
of the loan contract.’’
44
A California 
state law forbade a Federal savings and 
loan association from exercising due-on- 
sale clauses at its option and ‘‘deprived 
the lender of the ‘flexibility’ ’’ given to 
it by federal law.
45
As such, the state 
law created a direct conflict with the 
federal regulation and was preempted.
46
 
Similarly, in Barnett, the state law forbade banks from engaging in a power 
that Congress had expressly authorized 
(selling insurance in small towns), and 
in Franklin, the state law prohibited banks from using the word ‘‘savings’’ in 
advertising, even though Congress had 
specifically authorized banks to receive 
‘‘savings deposits.’’47
In both cases, 
these state laws created similar direct 
conflicts with federal law and were 
preempted. Other federal courts have 
repeatedly reached similar conclusions 
where state law would prohibit national 
banks from exercising the flexibility 
granted to them by federal law, 
including as codified in OCC 
regulations addressing both enumerated 
powers and powers that part of or 
incidental to the business of banking.
48
 
Moreover, while Franklin concerned a direct conflict created by the prohibition 
on the use of a particular 
Congressionally recognized term, the 
decision also reflects a more holistic 
assessment of the nature and degree of 
interference caused by the state law 
based on the view that national banks 
must be permitted to efficiently and 
effectively exercise the full range of 
powers granted to them by Congress.
49
 
Given the role of advertising in modern 
business, the Court concluded that ‘‘[i]t 
would require some affirmative 
indication to justify an interpretation 
that would permit a national bank to 
engage in a business’’ but give them ‘‘no 
right to let the public know about it.’’
50
 
That is, the power to advertise savings 
accounts emanated from the power to

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61097 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules 51
This view of national bank powers is consistent 
with Supreme Court precedent recognizing that 
national banks are entitled to exercise National 
Bank Act powers inherent in the operation of the 
business of banking. See NationsBank of North 
Carolina, N.A. v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co., 513 U.S. 251, 258, n.2 (Jan. 18, 1995) (‘‘We expressly 
hold that the ‘business of banking’ is not limited to 
the enumerated powers in § 24 Seventh and that the 
Comptroller therefore has discretion to authorize 
activities beyond those specifically enumerated.’’). 
See also M & M Leasing Corp. v. Seattle First Nat’l Bank, 563 F.2d 1377, 1382 (9th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 956 (1978) (‘‘[T]he National Bank Act did not freeze the practices of national banks 
in their nineteenth century forms.... [W]hatever the scope of such powers may be, we believe the 
powers of national banks must be construed to 
permit the use of new ways of conducting the very 
old business of banking.’’); 12 CFR 7.1000. 
52
Cantero, 602 U.S. at 216. 53
Fidelity, 458 U.S. at 153 (‘‘Federal regulations have no less pre-emptive effect than federal 
statutes.’’). 
54
See also cases cited supra note 48. 55
This may be magnified when considering the 
cumulative effect of complying not only with New 
York’s law but also with varying laws in multiple 
states. See San Jose, 262 U.S. at 370 (‘‘If California may thus interfere other States may do likewise; 
and . . . varying limitations may be prescribed.’’). 
56
The state law at issue in Franklin did not prohibit national banks from advertising their 
savings deposits, and it is not hard to imagine a 
national bank being able to use a different 
advertising formulation to similar competitive 
effect.

Retail, 589 F.3d at 283 (citation omitted) and quoting Am. Bankers Ass’n v. Lockyer, 239 F. Supp. 2d 1000, 1017 (E.D. Ca. 2002) (‘‘The threshold of 
preemption is in some cases remarkably low.’’)). 
58
See Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., 550 U.S. 1, 12–13 (2007); see also 12 CFR 34.4. 
59
While Iowa has an interest-on-escrow law, the 
OCC understands it to be permissive. In addition, 
the OCC understands that New Hampshire has an 
interest-on-escrow law that only applies to banks 
chartered by the state. As such, the OCC proposes 
to exclude these state laws from this proposed 
preemption determination. 
60
44 U.S.C. 3501–3521. 
61
5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. 
receive savings deposits, even if it was 
not explicitly enumerated.
51
Because 
the state law prohibited banks from 
‘‘using the commonly understood 
description,’’ it interfered with banks’ 
ability to ‘‘effectively’’ and ‘‘efficiently’’ 
exercise their power to advertising and 
was preempted.
52
 
These cases make clear that New 
York’s interest-on-escrow law prevents 
or significantly interferes with a 
national bank’s exercise of federally 
authorized powers. The conflict is 
especially clear in light of the OCC’s 
proposed escrow rule.
53
Much like 
Fidelity, Barnett, and Franklin, compliance with this New York law 
would forbid national banks from 
exercising discretion regarding the 
payment of interest-on-escrow and the 
assessment of related fees and thus 
deprive them of the flexibility granted 
by federal law and confirmed by the 
OCC’s proposed escrow rule.
54
As such, 
New York’s interest-on-escrow law 
creates a direct conflict with this OCC 
regulation. 
In addition, much like the state law in 
Franklin, compliance with New York’s interest-on-escrow law would interfere 
with national banks’ ability to 
efficiently and effectively exercise their 
real estate and related escrow powers. 
The discretion to set the terms and 
conditions of an escrow account in 
accordance with informed business 
judgment allows banks to appropriately 
balance the costs and benefits of 
establishing and maintaining these 
accounts and, ultimately, the risks and 
rewards of real estate lending more 
generally. If, for example, the state’s 
mandated interest rate renders escrow 
accounts unprofitable in light of 
dynamic market rates and variable 
business conditions, this may cause 
national banks to, among other things, 
offer escrow accounts on fewer real 
estate loans; attempt to recoup costs in 
other ways; or even reduce lending.
55
 
Moreover, by generally prohibiting 
related service charges, New York’s 
interest-on-escrow law would further 
limit a national bank’s ability to defray 
costs, compounding its effect. This type 
of interference with national bank 
powers is at least as significant as a 
restriction on a national bank’s power to 
advertise using a specific word.
56
 
As federal courts have recognized, 
‘‘ ‘the level of interference that gives rise 
to preemption under the [National Bank 
Act] is not very high.’ ’’
57
Therefore, 
under the Barnett standard as clarified in Cantero, New York’s interest-on- escrow law is preempted and ‘‘must 
give way’’ to federal law.
58
 
B. State Laws With Substantively 
Equivalent Terms 
In addition to New York, at least 11 
other states have interest-on-escrow 
laws that purport to apply to national 
banks: California, Connecticut, Maine, 
Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, 
Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, 
and Wisconsin.
59
Much like New York’s 
interest-on-escrow law, these state laws 
(1) require the payment of interest on 
funds deposited in certain real estate 
escrow accounts; and (2) in some cases, 
restrict the assessment of fees in 
connection with such accounts. The 
OCC is also proposing to determine that 
each of these state laws have 
substantively equivalent terms to New 
York’s Gen. Oblig. Law section 5–601 
and are thus also preempted. They each 
have the same effect as New York’s 
interest-on-escrow law: they deprive 
national banks of the flexibility to 
exercise the discretion that federal law, 
as confirmed in the OCC’s regulation, 
vests in them. Consistent with section 
25b, the OCC will consult with the 
CFPB on whether these state laws have 
substantively equivalent terms. 
Accordingly, the OCC proposes to 
include these state interest-on-escrow 
laws in its preemption determination. 
III. Request for Comment 
The OCC invites comments on all 
aspects of this proposed preemption 
determination. The OCC specifically 
requests comment on whether there are 
any additional laws that have 
substantively equivalent terms to New 
York’s law, including regarding the 
payment of interest-on-escrow or the 
assessment of related fees. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
A. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995
60
(PRA) states that no agency may 
conduct or sponsor, nor is the 
respondent required to respond to, an 
information collection unless it displays 
a currently valid Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) control number. The 
OCC has reviewed this proposal and 
determined that it does not create any 
information collection or revise any 
existing collection of information. 
Accordingly, no PRA submissions to 
OMB will be made with respect to this 
proposal. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA)
61
requires an agency to consider 
the impact of its proposed rules on 
small entities. In connection with a 
proposed rule, the RFA generally 
requires an agency to prepare an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) 
describing the impact of the rule on 
small entities, unless the head of the 
agency certifies that the proposed rule 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities and publishes such certification 
along with a statement providing the 
factual basis for such certification in the 
Federal Register. An IRFA must 
contain: (1) a description of the reasons 
why action by the agency is being 
considered; (2) a succinct statement of 
the objectives of, and legal basis for, the 
proposed rule; (3) a description of and, 
where feasible, an estimate of the 
number of small entities to which the 
proposed rule will apply; (4) a 
description of the projected reporting, 
recordkeeping, and other compliance 
requirements of the proposed rule, 
including an estimate of the classes of 
small entities that will be subject to the

Based on data accessed using the OCC’s 
Financial Institutions Data Retrieval System on 
November 20, 2025. 
63
The OCC bases its estimate of the number of 
small entities on the Small Business 
Administration’s size thresholds for commercial 
banks and savings institutions, and trust 
companies, which are $850 million and $47 
million, respectively. Consistent with the General 
Principles of Affiliation, 13 CFR 121.103(a), the 
OCC counted the assets of affiliated financial 
institutions when determining if it should classify 
an OCC-supervised institution as a small entity. The 
OCC used average quarterly assets in December 31, 
2024 to determine size because a ‘‘financial 
institution’s assets are determined by averaging the 
assets reported on its four quarterly financial 
statements for the preceding year.’’ See footnote 8 of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Table of Size Standards.

requirements and the type of 
professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record; (5) 
an identification, to the extent 
practicable, of all relevant Federal rules 
that may duplicate, overlap with, or 
conflict with the proposed rule; and (6) 
a description of any significant 
alternatives to the proposed rule that 
accomplish its stated objectives. 
The OCC currently supervises 1,005 
institutions (national banks, Federal 
savings associations, and branches or 
agencies of foreign banks),
62
of which 
approximately 609 are small entities 
under the RFA.
63
 
In general, the OCC classifies the 
economic impact on an individual small 
entity as significant if the total 
estimated impact in one year is greater 
than 5 percent of the small entity’s total 
annual salaries and benefits or greater 
than 2.5 percent of the small entity’s 
total non-interest expense. Furthermore, 
the OCC considers 5 percent or more of 
OCC-supervised small entities to be a 
substantial number, and at present, 30 
OCC-supervised small entities would 
constitute a substantial number. While 
the proposed rule would impact all 
OCC-supervised small entities, it would 
likely result in some cost savings for 
those institutions. Therefore, the OCC 
certifies that this proposed preemption 
determination, if adopted, will not have 
a significant impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
C. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 
1995 
The OCC has analyzed the proposed 
rule under the factors in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(UMRA).
64
Under this analysis, the OCC 
considered whether the proposed rule 
includes a federal mandate that may 
result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
or by the private sector, of $100 million 
or more in any one year ($187 million 
as adjusted annually for inflation). 
Pursuant to section 202 of the UMRA,
65
 
if a proposed rule meets this UMRA 
threshold, the OCC would prepares a 
written statement that includes, among 
other things, a cost-benefit analysis of 
the proposal. 
This proposal imposes no new 
mandates and would likely result in a 
decrease in expenditures from OCC- 
supervised entities that may elect not to 
pay interest on funds held in escrow 
accounts. Therefore, the OCC concludes 
that this proposal determination, if 
finalized, would not result in an 
expenditure of $187 million or more 
annually by any State, local, and Tribal 
government, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector. 
D. Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
Pursuant to section 302(a) of the 
Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act (RCDRIA) 
of 1994,
66
in determining the effective 
date and administrative compliance 
requirements for new regulations that 
impose additional reporting, disclosure, 
or other requirements on insured 
depository institutions, the OCC must 
consider, consistent with principles of 
safety and soundness and the public 
interest (1) any administrative burdens 
that the final rule would place on 
depository institutions, including small 
depository institutions and customers of 
depository institutions and (2) the 
benefits of the final rule. This 
rulemaking would not impose any 
reporting, disclosure, or other 
requirements on insured depository 
institutions. Therefore, section 302(a) 
does not apply to this proposal. 
E. Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability 
Through Transparency Act of 2023
67
 
requires that a notice of proposed 
rulemaking include the internet address 
of a summary of not more than 100 
words in length of a proposed rule, in 
plain language, that shall be posted on 
the internet website 
www.regulations.gov. 
The OCC is proposing to issue a 
preemption determination concluding 
that federal law preempts state laws that 
eliminate OCC-regulated banks’ 
flexibility to decide whether and to 
what extent to (1) pay interest or other 
compensation on funds placed in real 
estate escrow accounts; or (2) assess fees 
in connection with such accounts. This 
preemption determination would 
provide much needed clarity to banks 
and other stakeholders. 
The proposal and required summary 
can be found for the OCC at https://
www.regulations.gov by searching for Docket ID OCC–2025–0735 and https://

F. Executive Order 12866 (as Amended) 
Executive Order 12866, titled 
‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review,’’ as 
amended, requires the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA), OMB, to determine whether a 
proposed rule is a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ prior to the 
disclosure of the proposed rule to the 
public. If OIRA finds the proposed rule 
to be a ‘‘significant regulatory action,’’ 
Executive Order 12866 requires the OCC 
to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the 
proposed rule and for OIRA to conduct 
a review of the proposed rule prior to 
publication in the Federal Register. 
Executive Order 12866 defines a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ to mean 
a regulatory action that is likely to (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more or adversely 
affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or State, local, 
or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or 
the principles set forth in Executive 
Order 12866. 
OIRA has determined that this 
proposed rule is not a significant 
regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of 
Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, is 
not subject to review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
G. Executive Order 14192 
Executive Order 14192, titled 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’ requires that an agency, 
unless prohibited by law, identify at 
least 10 existing regulations to be 
repealed when the agency publicly 
proposes for notice and comment or 
otherwise promulgates a new regulation 
with total costs greater than zero. 
Executive Order 14192 further requires 
that new incremental costs associated 
with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61099 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules with at least 10 prior regulations. The 
OCC expects the proposal, if finalized, 
will be a deregulatory action under 
Executive Order 14192 because it would 
result in potential cost savings for OCC- 
supervised banks.

Unlike principal and interest payments on the 
mortgage loan, which are typically due monthly 
and are consistent over time, tax, insurance, and 
certain other payments related to the mortgaged 
property are typically due less frequently (e.g., 
every six-months) and may change throughout the 
life of the mortgage loan due to, for example, 
changes in local property tax rates, the assessed tax 
value of the property, or annual insurance premium 
adjustments. Such lump sum payments thus mean 
that total mortgage-related payments on these tax, 
insurance, or other payments due dates are 
typically larger and may vary over time.

I. Introduction 
Real estate lending has been core to 
the business of national banks for over 
100 years and of Federal savings 
associations for their entire existence of 
over 90 years. Banks are a key pillar 
supporting homeownership and 
commercial real estate in the U.S. In 
order for banks to engage in effective 
and efficient real estate lending, they 
use a variety of tools to safely and 
soundly manage the associated risks. 
Mortgages have several features that set 
them apart from most of banks’ other 
extensions of credit, including that they 
are typically overcollateralized and the 
collateral is unique, is often illiquid, 
and can be subject to acts of nature that 
rapidly depreciate its value. As such, a 
significant risk in mortgage lending is 
related to a bank’s ability to assess, 
manage, and preserve the underlying 
collateral.
1
Since the late 1930s, escrow 
accounts have become a crucial risk 
mitigation tool that supports safe and 
sound mortgage lending. Specifically, a 
lender may require a borrower to prepay 
a portion of their annual property taxes, 
insurance premiums, and certain other 
payments relating to the mortgaged 
property, which the lender places into 
an escrow account. When those 
payments become due, the lender then 
forwards the payment to the applicable 
party.
2
 
From the lender’s perspective, escrow 
accounts can ensure in advance that 
these payments will be met, which in 
turn enables the lender to protect the 
priority of its mortgage lien and the 
value of the collateral. Should a 
borrower fail to pay property taxes, for 
example, a tax lien is, in general, 
superior to the lender’s mortgage lien.
3
 
If a municipality forced a sale of the 
property to collect on the taxes owed to 
it, there may be insufficient proceeds 
left over from the sale of the property to 
enable the borrower to satisfy the 
remaining real estate loan. Similarly, 
should a borrower fail to pay premiums 
on an insurance policy covering the 
property, the lender may bear the risk of 
uninsured damage to the collateral. For 
example, the borrower may cease 
payment on the real estate loan if the 
property becomes so damaged that its 
market price is less than the outstanding 
mortgage balance. In this case, the 
lender may be unable to recover the 
value of the outstanding mortgage loan 
through foreclosure on and sale of the 
collateral property. 
From the borrower’s perspective, 
escrow accounts can help the borrower 
budget for tax, insurance, and other 
payments.
4
Use of an escrow account 
also simplifies the operational aspects 
associated with making payments and 
confirming satisfaction of the borrower’s 
obligations to multiple parties. 
In light of those benefits to both 
lenders and borrowers, escrow accounts 
are widely used. For example, 
approximately 80% of U.S. residential 
real estate mortgages use an escrow 
account.
5
While banks typically provide 
escrow accounts free of charge, banks 
nonetheless incur costs and assume 
risks related to administering these 
accounts, including the operational 
costs of building escrow systems, 
ensuring payments are timely made to 
the relevant parties, and complying with 
contractual terms and applicable law.
6
 
When banks establish and maintain 
escrow accounts, they make a variety of 
decisions that collectively allow them to 
balance these costs and risks with the 
benefits of such accounts. For example, 
banks may recoup some of these costs 
through investing escrow funds, 
typically in short term assets. Banks 
may also choose to pay interest on such 
accounts or otherwise offer some form 
of related compensation to mortgage 
borrowers. These decisions may be 
informed by the bank’s business 
strategy, costs, market demand, 
competition from other real estate 
lenders, and eligibility requirements for 
certain mortgage insurance programs,
7
 
among other considerations. 
The terms and conditions of escrow 
accounts, including whether and to 
what extent banks pay interest or other 
compensation, are ultimately a business 
judgment made by each bank in 
accordance with safe and sound banking 
principles. This discretion ensures that 
banks have the flexibility to make 
business decisions about how to 
effectively and efficiently set the terms 
and conditions of their escrow accounts, 
which allows them to appropriately 
balance the costs and benefits of these 
accounts and the risks and rewards of 
real estate lending more generally. As 
such, it is a core component of banks’ 
mortgage lending powers under 
applicable law, including provisions of 
the Federal Reserve Act,
8
the Home 
Owners Loan Act of 1933 (HOLA),
9
and 
the National Bank Act.

banking. As the district court recognized, [t]he

foreclose when the borrower defaulted.’’ (citation

See also 12 CFR 7.4002 (providing that a 
national bank may charge non-interest fees, 
including deposit account service charges, and that 
the establishment, amount, and method of 
calculation are business decisions made by each 
national bank it its discretion). As noted above, 
escrow accounts are typically provided free of cost 
to consumers. However, a bank’s decision to not 
charge permissible fees may in many cases be 
underwritten by reasonable short-term returns that 
banks are able to earn on escrowed funds. 
the OCC is proposing to codify in its 
regulations governing the mortgage 
lending powers of national banks and 
Federal savings associations, 
respectively, for the sake of clarity. 
Codifying this longstanding power will 
reduce uncertainty with regards to bank 
escrow practices and may thereby 
incentivize increased bank mortgage 
lending. 
II. National Banks’ Real Estate Lending 
and Escrow Account Powers 
The Federal Reserve Act and HOLA, 
respectively, evince clear Congressional 
intent to provide banks with broad, 
discretionary real estate lending powers, 
which includes the flexibility to make 
business decisions about how to 
effectively and efficiently set the terms 
and conditions of escrow accounts. Each 
of these statutes also provides the OCC 
broad discretionary grants of rulemaking 
authority. Additionally, the flexibility to 
make business judgments concerning 
the investment and use of escrowed 
funds has long since been inherent to 
the business of banking codified in the 
National Bank Act. These practices are 
the logical outgrowth or functional 
equivalent of other longstanding 
permissible bank practices regarding 
collateral protection. They benefit the 
bank and its customers and are well 
within the types of risks national banks 
manage in the ordinary course of 
business. 
Broad Real Estate Lending Powers 
Under the Federal Reserve Act and 
HOLA 
National banks are authorized under 
the Federal Reserve Act to ‘‘make, 
arrange, purchase or sell loans or 
extensions of credit secured by liens on 
interests in real estate,’’ subject to 
requirements imposed by the OCC.
12
 
Congress has progressively expanded 
national banks’ mortgage lending 
powers under this law. Initially limited 
to loans on farmland,
13
Congress 
amended the law to include limited 
general real estate lending in 1916
14
 
and, through the years, removed all 
limits and conditions on real estate 
lending other than those prescribed in 
regulation by the Comptroller.
15
The 
Federal Reserve Act provides the OCC 
broad authority to prescribe regulations 
governing national banks’ loans or 
extensions of credit secured by liens on 
interest in real estate.
16
 
Likewise, residential mortgage 
lending is the central business of 
Federal savings associations.
17
The 
explicit purpose of HOLA is to create a 
Federal chartering regime for 
institutions that provide credit for 
housing.
18
HOLA provides Federal 
savings associations broad powers to 
invest in, sell, or otherwise deal in 
residential real property loans, subject 
to regulations issued by the 
Comptroller.
19
HOLA also provides the 
OCC with broad authority to prescribe 
rules and regulations to provide for the 
organization, incorporation, 
examination, operation, and 
regulation
20
of Federal savings 
associations and to specify their powers 
to invest in, sell, or otherwise deal in 
various loans and other investments.
21
 
Since the earliest days of the Federal 
banking system, courts have held that 
banks have wide latitude in managing 
and protecting property acquired in the 
usual course of banking, even where 
such activities are not otherwise 
permissible.
22
Courts have also 
explicitly linked the power to lend as 
inextricably bound up in the power to 
make good on collateral.
23
As such, it is 
clear that the discretion afforded a bank 
in making business judgments related to 
real estate lending does not end when 
a bank decides the means by which to 
finance the costs of managing and 
protecting property that serves as 
collateral for its loans.
24
 
This history, and the statutory role of 
the OCC as the agency delegated 
discretion in enacting real estate lending 
regulations for both national banks and 
Federal savings associations, evince a 
clear Congressional intent to provide 
banks with broad, discretionary real 
estate lending powers. 
This intent is clear too from the 
primary piece of Federal legislation 
governing escrow accounts. In the

to regulate the amount of money that a borrower is 
required to deposit in escrow by tying that amount 
to the costs the escrow fund is meant to secure. 
RESPA is not, however, designed to reduce the 
dollar costs of taxes, fees, and insurance premiums. 
RESPA can, and does, accomplish its task by setting 
rules on required escrow contributions. That this 
system may, in the end, be more expensive to 
borrowers than, say, keeping their money in 
interest-bearing accounts to pay their own bills, 
does not violate RESPA’s stated goal of ‘reduc[ing] 
the amounts home buyers are required to place in 
escrow accounts.’ ’’ (citations omitted)). 
32
Indeed, Congress has left these business 
decisions to a bank’s discretion except in specific 
limited circumstances. See 15 U.S.C. 1639d. 33

activity is ‘‘incidental to the business of banking if 
it is convenient or useful to an activity that is 
specifically authorized for national banks or to an 
activity that is otherwise part of the business of 
banking.’’ The OCC considers the following factors 
in such analysis: ‘‘(i) Whether the activity facilitates 
the production or delivery of a bank’s products or 
services, enhances the bank’s ability to sell or 
market its products or services, or improves the 
effectiveness or efficiency of the bank’s operations, 
in light of risks presented, innovations, strategies, 
techniques and new technologies for producing and 
delivering financial products and services; and (ii) 
Whether the activity enables the bank to use 
capacity acquired for its banking operations or 
otherwise avoid economic loss or waste.’’ 12 CFR 
7.1000(d)(1). 
39
See supra notes 22–23 and accompanying text. 
40
See OCC, Interpretive Letter No. 1041 (Sept. 28, 2005) (‘‘[T]he first three activities listed when the 
Bank acts as escrow agent [receiving funds, 
depositing funds into a separate non-interest escrow 
account, and honoring checks written against the 
account] constitute depository and check cashing 
functions that are enumerated powers set forth in 
statutory law.’’); OCC, Corporate Decision No. 98– 
09 (Jan. 28, 1998) (‘‘[I]nterest rates paid by the bank on its deposit accounts are generally a business 
decision as long as the rates do not violate federal 
banking laws or regulations.... [I]t is generally a 1970s, Congress determined that certain 
abuses in mortgage lenders’ real estate 
settlement processes necessitated 
nationwide reform, including with 
respect to lenders that were requiring 
excessive funds be placed in escrow 
accounts.
25
Enacted in 1974, the Real 
Estate Settlement Procedures Act 
(RESPA)
26
extensively regulates the use 
and operation of escrow accounts in 
residential real estate loans. It requires 
disclosures as to the nature and 
purposes of escrow accounts,
27
 
mandates the provision of free annual 
escrow account statements,
28
requires 
amounts in escrow accounts be paid 
timely as they become due and any 
funds remaining in such accounts after 
the loan is repaid be promptly returned 
to the borrower,
29
and establishes 
proportional caps on the total amounts 
that may be collected from borrowers in 
escrow accounts.
30
RESPA does not, 
however, include any provisions related 
to the use of funds in escrow accounts 
or require lenders to pay compensation 
on such accounts. RESPA, in legislating 
a system of escrow account disclosures 
and amount limits, implicitly recognizes 
the flexibility banks have in deciding 
how to invest, and whether and to what 
extent to pay interest on escrowed 
funds.
31
 
Congress has largely refrained from 
interfering with the flexibility of banks 
in setting the terms and conditions of 
how escrowed funds are handled by the 
bank.
32
This flexibility allows banks to 
efficiently and effectively balance the 
risks and rewards of mortgage lending, 
just as banks do with other aspects of 
the credit underwriting and lending 
process. The OCC has long recognized 
this principle as well. For example, the 
Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate 
Lending state that each insured depository institution should establish 
loan administration procedures for its 
real estate portfolio that address 
‘‘escrow administration,’’ along with 
other core aspects of the lending 
arrangements, including 
‘‘documentation,’’ ‘‘loan closing and 
disbursement,’’ ‘‘payment processing,’’ 
‘‘collateral administration,’’ ‘‘loan 
payoffs,’’ ‘‘collections and foreclosures,’’ 
‘‘claims processing,’’ and ‘‘servicing and 
participation agreements.’’
33
That is, 
the Guidelines outline broad topics for banks to address, including escrow 
administration, but give banks 
substantial flexibility in how to address 
them. 
More generally, neither the Federal 
Reserve Act, HOLA, nor the National 
Bank Act displaces a national bank’s or 
Federal savings association’s general 
business judgment with respect to 
compensation paid to or fees assessed 
on customers. For example, no Federal 
law dictates or contemplates a 
minimum interest rate that national 
banks or Federal savings associations 
must pay on general deposit accounts. 
Additionally, a national bank’s non- 
interest charges and fees are subject 
only to the bank’s ‘‘discretion, according 
to sound banking judgment and safe and 
sound banking principles.’’
34
 
Business of Banking 
Furthermore, national banks are 
permitted to engage in the business of 
banking more generally and ‘‘all such 
incidental powers as shall be necessary 
to carry on the business of banking.’’
35
 
Courts have noted that ‘‘the National 
Bank Act did not freeze the practices of 
national banks in their nineteenth 
century forms.... [W]hatever the scope of such powers may be, we 
believe the powers of national banks 
must be construed to permit the use of 
new ways of conducting the very old 
business of banking.’’
36
 
Given the discussion in the preceding 
section, the OCC has consistently taken 
the position that escrow accounts 
activities are part of the business of 
banking.
37
The OCC considers the 
following factors for determining 
whether an activity that is not explicitly 
enumerated in 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh) is 
nonetheless part of the business of 
banking: 
(i) Whether the activity is the 
functional equivalent to, or a logical 
outgrowth of, a recognized banking 
activity; 
(ii) Whether the activity strengthens 
the bank by benefiting its customers or 
its business; 
(iii) Whether the activity involves 
risks similar in nature to those already 
assumed by banks; and 
(iv) Whether the activity is authorized 
for State-chartered banks.
38
 
Flexibility to exercise a national 
bank’s business judgment as to how to 
structure its escrow operations and 
whether and what extent to offer any 
compensation to customers is a clear 
logical outgrowth of national banks’ 
other powers to manage and protect 
collateral. As discussed above, courts 
have long recognized the wide latitude 
that banks have in the activities they 
may undertake in managing and 
protecting collateral on loans.
39
 
Furthermore, this flexibility can also be 
seen as the functional equivalent of 
national banks’ deposit taking powers. 
Escrow funds are placed into an account 
and, just like any other account, it is a 
fundamental precept of banking that the 
bank has flexibility in determining 
what, if any, interest is paid on such 
accounts.

41
See Clement Nat’l Bank v. Vermont, 231 U.S. 120, 140–41 (1913) (allowing national banks to pay 
state taxes on depositors’ accounts from their 
customers’ account balances in part justified by the 
benefit to each customer in not having to separately 
calculate the tax and submit an individual tax 
return, which would remove unnecessary obstacles 
to the successful prosecution of the bank’s 
business). See also M & M Leasing Corp., 563 F.2d at 1381–82 (holding that leases of personal property 
constitute the loan of money secured by the 
properties leased, and so are part of the business 
of banking. In reaching this holding, the court noted 
that ‘‘leasing yields to the banks a rate of return that 
compares favorably to that of lending. A portfolio 
of prudently-arranged leases imposes no greater 
risks than one of equally prudently-arranged loans. 
It is small wonder, therefore, that today over 1000 
national banks are engaged in the leasing of 
personal property which has an aggregate value in 
excess of $2 billion.’’). Compare the flexibility of 
national banks to structure secured lending 
programs as leases and the wide adoption of 
national bank leasing programs to the flexibility 
banks may exercise in structuring their escrow 
accounts and their adoption in approximately 80% 
of mortgages. See supra note 5.

See Iowa Code 524.905(2) (2025) (‘‘A bank receiving funds in escrow pursuant to an escrow

44
The states that require their own state-chartered 
banks to pay specified interest amounts on 
mortgage escrow accounts include California (Cal. 
Civ. Code § 2954.8 (2025)), Connecticut (Conn. Gen. 
Stat. § 49–2a (2025)), Maine (Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 
9–B, § 429; Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, § 504 (2025)),

8, § 10404 (2025)), and Wisconsin (Wis. Stat. 
§§ 138.051; 138.052 (2025)). 
45
While Federal law vests banks with broad 
discretion, banks’ real estate lending operations 
may be subject to additional requirements under 
Federal law, and any such operations should be 
conducted pursuant to safe and sound banking 
principles and the terms of any applicable 
agreement with the borrower. 
46
44 U.S.C. 3501–3521. 
47
5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. 
Flexibility to exercise a national 
bank’s business judgment as to how to 
structure the financing of its escrow 
operations can also strengthen a 
national bank by benefiting its 
customers or its business. As noted 
above, this flexibility allows banks to 
defray the costs of providing escrow 
services, including coordinating 
payments by the customer to multiple 
different parties free of charge.
41
While 
a bank’s customers may not receive any 
interest payments if the bank decides 
not to offer it, the bank’s ability to 
exercise its business judgment in how it 
structures its escrow operations may 
make it more likely for the bank to use 
escrow accounts in its mortgage lending 
operations, with their attendant benefits 
to both the lender and borrower, and 
offer lower prices or fees. For example, 
if national banks were required to use 
some fixed interest calculation to 
determine what compensation to pay to 
customers using escrow accounts, 
should market interest rates fall below 
such threshold, then banks could face 
losses on their provision of escrow 
accounts and may reasonably decide, 
where practicable, to desist from using 
escrow accounts, implement fees, 
otherwise increase borrower costs to 
offset such loses, or reduce their overall 
mortgage lending due to decreased 
profitability. 
National banks also have a core 
competency in managing risks 
associated with fee structures and 
investing funds. In exercising its 
business judgment as to how to 
structure the financing of its escrow 
operations, a bank does not ‘‘assume[ ] 
material burdens other than those of a 
lender of money and is [not] subject to 
significant risks not ordinarily incident 
to a secured loan.’’
42
Rather, it 
continues to protect its security interest 
and the attendant collateral while 
managing investment risks associated 
with what are typically short-term 
investments using the escrowed funds. 
Finally, roughly three quarters of 
states permit state-chartered banks 
flexibility to exercise their business 
judgment as to how to structure the 
financing of their escrow operations for 
residential real estate lending, either 
explicitly
43
or implicitly in silence on 
the subject,
44
and the OCC is not aware 
of any state restricting this flexibility 
with regards to commercial real estate 
lending. 
* * * * * 
As such, these statutory schemes 
make clear that the flexibility of banks 
to make the appropriate business 
judgment in structuring escrow 
accounts and investing related funds is 
a core component of banks’ broad 
mortgage lending powers under 
applicable law. The OCC has broad 
authority to prescribe regulations that 
would codify this flexibility. 
III. Description of the Proposed Rule 
The proposed rule would amend the 
OCC’s real estate lending and appraisals 
regulations applicable to national banks 
and its lending and investment 
regulations applicable to Federal 
savings associations to add a definition 
of ‘‘escrow account,’’ expressly codify 
banks’ power to establish and maintain 
escrow accounts, and to clarify that the 
terms and conditions of escrow 
accounts, including the extent of any 
compensation paid to customers, are 
business decisions to be made by each 
bank. The OCC proposes to define 
‘‘escrow accounts’’ used by national 
banks as an account established in 
connection with a loan or extension of 
credit secured by a lien on interest in 
real estate in which the borrower places 
funds for the purpose of assuring 
payment of taxes, insurance premiums, 
or other charges with respect to the 
property. The OCC proposes to define 
‘‘escrow accounts’’ in substantially 
similarly terms in the context of Federal 
savings associations. 
The OCC also proposes to codify 
national banks’ escrow powers, 
including the flexibility such banks 
have as to how to organize and manage 
escrow accounts. Specifically, the OCC 
proposes to codify that (1) the powers of 
national banks include establishing and 
maintaining escrow accounts in 
connection with real estate loans; and 
(2) the terms and conditions of such 
escrow accounts (including, but not 
limited to, the investment of escrowed 
funds, fees assessed for the use of such 
accounts, and whether and to what 
extent interest or other compensation is 
calculated and paid to customers whose 
funds are placed in the escrow account) 
are business decisions to be made by 
each national bank in its discretion. The 
OCC proposes to codify these powers in 
the context of Federal savings 
associations in substantially similar 
terms.
45
 
IV. Regulatory Analysis 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(PRA)
46
states that no agency may 
conduct or sponsor, nor is the 
respondent required to respond to, an 
information collection unless it displays 
a currently valid Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) control number. The 
OCC has reviewed this proposed rule 
and determined that it does not create 
any information collection or revise any 
existing collection of information. 
Accordingly, no PRA submissions to 
OMB will be made with respect to this 
proposed rule. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(RFA)
47
requires an agency to consider 
the impact of its proposed rules on 
small entities. In connection with a 
proposed rule, the RFA generally 
requires an agency to prepare an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) 
describing the impact of the rule on 
small entities, unless the head of the

Principles of Affiliation, 13 CFR 121.103(a), the 
OCC counted the assets of affiliated financial 
institutions when determining if it should classify 
an OCC-supervised institution as a small entity. The 
OCC used average quarterly assets in December 31, 
2024 to determine size because a ‘‘financial 
institution’s assets are determined by averaging the 
assets reported on its four quarterly financial 
statements for the preceding year.’’ See footnote 8 of the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Table of Size Standards.

agency certifies that the proposed rule 
will not have a significant economic 
impact on a substantial number of small 
entities and publishes such certification 
along with a statement providing the 
factual basis for such certification in the 
Federal Register. An IRFA must 
contain: (1) a description of the reasons 
why action by the agency is being 
considered; (2) a succinct statement of 
the objectives of, and legal basis for, the 
proposed rule; (3) a description of and, 
where feasible, an estimate of the 
number of small entities to which the 
proposed rule will apply; (4) a 
description of the projected reporting, 
recordkeeping, and other compliance 
requirements of the proposed rule, 
including an estimate of the classes of 
small entities that will be subject to the 
requirements and the type of 
professional skills necessary for 
preparation of the report or record; (5) 
an identification, to the extent 
practicable, of all relevant Federal rules 
that may duplicate, overlap with, or 
conflict with the proposed rule; and (6) 
a description of any significant 
alternatives to the proposed rule that 
accomplish its stated objectives. 
The OCC currently supervises 1,005 
institutions (national banks, Federal 
savings associations, and branches or 
agencies of foreign banks),
48
of which 
approximately 609 are small entities 
under the RFA.
49
 
In general, the OCC classifies the 
economic impact on an individual small 
entity as significant if the total 
estimated impact in one year is greater 
than 5 percent of the small entity’s total 
annual salaries and benefits or greater 
than 2.5 percent of the small entity’s 
total non-interest expense. Furthermore, 
the OCC considers 5 percent or more of 
OCC-supervised small entities to be a 
substantial number, and at present, 30 
OCC-supervised small entities would 
constitute a substantial number. Since 
the proposed rule would affect all OCC- 
supervised institutions, a substantial 
number of OCC-supervised small 
entities would be impacted. 
However, this proposed rulemaking 
imposes no new mandates, and thus no 
direct costs, on affected OCC-supervised 
institutions. Therefore, the OCC certifies 
that the proposed rule would not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
The OCC has analyzed the proposed 
rule under the factors in the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
(UMRA).
50
Under this analysis, the OCC 
considered whether the proposed rule 
includes a Federal mandate that may 
result in the expenditure by State, local, 
and tribal governments, in the aggregate, 
or by the private sector, of $100 million 
or more in any one year ($187 million 
as adjusted annually for inflation). 
Pursuant to section 202 of the UMRA,
51
 
if a proposed rule meets this UMRA 
threshold, the OCC would prepare a 
written statement that includes, among 
other things, a cost-benefit analysis of 
the proposal. 
This proposed rulemaking imposes no 
new mandates, and thus no direct costs, 
on affected OCC-supervised institutions. 
Therefore, the proposal would not 
require additional expenditure by any 
State, local, or tribal governments, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector of 
$187 million or more in any one year. 
Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 
Pursuant to section 302(a) of the 
Riegle Community Development and 
Regulatory Improvement Act (RCDRIA) 
of 1994,
52
in determining the effective 
date and administrative compliance 
requirements for new regulations that 
impose additional reporting, disclosure, 
or other requirements on insured 
depository institutions, the OCC must 
consider, consistent with principles of 
safety and soundness and the public 
interest, (1) any administrative burdens 
that the final rule would place on 
depository institutions, including small 
depository institutions and customers of 
depository institutions and (2) the 
benefits of the final rule. This 
rulemaking would not impose any 
reporting, disclosure, or other 
requirements on insured depository 
institutions. Therefore, section 302(a) 
does not apply to this proposed rule. 
Providing Accountability Through 
Transparency Act of 2023 
The Providing Accountability

requires that a notice of proposed 
rulemaking include the internet address 
of a summary of not more than 100 
words in length of a proposed rule, in 
plain language, that shall be posted on 
the internet website 
www.regulations.gov. 
The OCC is issuing a notice of 
proposed rulemaking to codify 
longstanding powers of national banks 
and Federal savings associations 
(collectively, banks) to establish or 
maintain real estate lending escrow 
accounts and to exercise flexibility in 
making business judgment as to the 
terms and conditions of such accounts, 
including whether and to what extent to 
offer any compensation or to assess any 
fees related thereto.

Executive Order 12866 (as Amended) 
Executive Order 12866, titled 
‘‘Regulatory Planning and Review,’’ as 
amended, requires the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs 
(OIRA), OMB, to determine whether a 
proposed rule is a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ prior to the 
disclosure of the proposed rule to the 
public. If OIRA finds the proposed rule 
to be a ‘‘significant regulatory action,’’ 
Executive Order 12866 requires the OCC 
to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the 
proposed rule and for OIRA to conduct 
a review of the proposed rule prior to 
publication in the Federal Register. 
Executive Order 12866 defines a 
‘‘significant regulatory action’’ to mean 
a regulatory action that is likely to (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more or adversely 
affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or State, local, 
or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, the President’s priorities, or

Order 12866. 
OIRA has determined that this 
proposed rule is not a significant 
regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of 
Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, is 
not subject to review under Executive 
Order 12866. 
Executive Order 14192 
Executive Order 14192, titled 
‘‘Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation,’’ requires that an agency, 
unless prohibited by law, identify at 
least 10 existing regulations to be 
repealed when the agency publicly 
proposes for notice and comment or 
otherwise promulgates a new regulation 
with total costs greater than zero. 
Executive Order 14192 further requires 
that new incremental costs associated 
with new regulations shall, to the extent 
permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated 
with at least 10 prior regulations. This 
proposed rule is a deregulatory action 
under Executive Order 14192 because it 
would provide legal clarity (and 
therefore a potential reduction in legal- 
related costs) on how banks may 
structure the financing of their escrow 
operations and whether (and, if so, to 
what extent) to offer any compensation 
to customers or assess any fee.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
The FAA’s authority to issue rules 
regarding aviation safety is found in 
Title 49 of the United States Code. 
Subtitle I, Section 106 describes the 
authority of the FAA Administrator. 
Subtitle VII, Aviation Programs, 
describes in more detail the scope of the 
agency’s authority. This rulemaking is 
promulgated under the authority 
described in Subtitle VII, Part A, 
Subpart I, Section 40103. Under that 
section, the FAA is charged with 
prescribing regulations to assign the use 
of the airspace necessary to ensure the 
safety of aircraft and the efficient use of 
airspace. This regulation is within the 
scope of that authority as it would 
modify Class E airspace to support IFR 
operations in Denver, CO. 
Comments Invited 
The FAA invites interested persons to 
participate in this rulemaking by 
submitting written comments, data, or 
views. Comments are specifically 
invited on the overall regulatory, 
aeronautical, economic, environmental, 
and energy-related aspects of the 
proposal. The most helpful comments 
reference a specific portion of the 
proposal, explain the reason for any 
recommended change, and include 
supporting data. To ensure the docket 
does not contain duplicate comments, 
commenters should submit only one 
time if comments are filed 
electronically, or commenters should 
send only one copy of written 
comments if comments are filed in 
writing. 
The FAA will file in the docket all 
comments it receives, as well as a report 
summarizing each substantive public 
contact with FAA personnel concerning 
this proposed rulemaking. Before acting 
on this proposal, the FAA will consider 
all comments it receives on or before the 
closing date for comments. The FAA 
will consider comments filed after the 
comment period has closed if it is 
possible to do so without incurring 
expense or delay. The FAA may change 
this proposal in light of the comments 
it receives. 
Privacy: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(c), DOT solicits comments from the 
public to better inform its rulemaking 
process. DOT posts these comments, 
without edit, including any personal 
information the commenter provides, to 
www.regulations.gov, as described in the system of records notice (DOT/ALL– 
14 FDMS), which can be reviewed at 
www.dot.gov/privacy.

An electronic copy of this document 
may be downloaded through the 
internet at www.regulations.gov. 
Recently published rulemaking 
documents can also be accessed through 
the FAA’s web page at www.faa.gov/air_

Incorporation by Reference 
Class E2 and Class E5 airspace 
designations are published in 
paragraphs 6002 and 6005, respectively, 
of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, 
which is incorporated by reference in 14 
CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and 
effective September 15, 2025. These 
updates would be published in the next 
update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA 
Order JO 7400.11K, which lists Class A, 
B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic 
service routes, and reporting points, is 
publicly available as listed in the 
ADDRESSESsection of this document. 
The Proposal 
The FAA is proposing an amendment 
to 14 CFR part 71 that would modify the 
transitional Class E airspace at Denver 
International Airport, Denver, CO, by 
expanding the portion of the Class E 
airspace extending upward from 700 
feet above the surface and removing the 
portion extending upward from 1,200 
feet above the surface. 
The transitional Class E airspace at 
Denver serves Denver International 
Airport and also provides containment 
for IFR aircraft departing/arriving at 
Denver’s surrounding airports. The 
Class E airspace at Denver extends to 
17.8 miles south of Centennial Airport, 
Denver, CO, to provide containment for 
Centennial Airport’s arriving IFR 
aircraft operations below 1,500 feet 
above the surface. The extension is not 
sufficient in size to fully capture the 
ZOMBZ SIX ARRIVAL Area Navigation 
(RNAV) procedure that guides aircraft 
arriving at Centennial Airport until 
established on an instrument arrival 
procedure (or otherwise). The Class E 
airspace extending upward from 700 
feet above the surface at Denver should 
be extended approximately four miles to 
the south to better contain the ZOMBZ 
SIX ARRIVAL (RNAV) procedure. The 
portion of Class E airspace extending 
upward from 1,200 feet above the 
surface at Denver should be removed, as 
the Denver Class E Domestic En Route 
Airspace provides sufficient 
containment and duplication is not 
necessary. 
Finally, the legal description for 
Denver’s Class E airspace extending 
upward from at least 700 feet above the 
surface uses the Denver Very High 
Frequency Omnidirectional Range/ 
Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/ 
DME) as its reference point (which is 
incorrectly listed as a VOR). In 
accordance with the VOR Minimum 
Operational Network (MON) 
Implementation Program (81 FR 48694), 
the Denver VOR/DME should no longer 
be used to describe the airspace as it 
was selected for phase two 
discontinuance from the National 
Airspace System. A ‘‘Point of Origin’’ 
with identical geographical coordinates 
as the Denver VOR/DME should be used 
to describe the airspace in its place.

proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and

and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February

preparation of a regulatory evaluation as 
the anticipated impact is so minimal. 
Since this is a routine matter that will 
only affect air traffic procedures and air 
navigation, it is certified that this 
proposed rule, when promulgated, will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance

Incorporation by Reference 
Class E2 and Class E5 airspace 
designations are published in 
paragraphs 6002 and 6005, respectively, 
of FAA Order JO 7400.11, Airspace 
Designations and Reporting Points, 
which is incorporated by reference in 14 
CFR 71.1 on an annual basis. This 
document proposes to amend the 
current version of that order, FAA Order 
JO 7400.11K, dated August 4, 2025, and 
effective September 15, 2025. These 
updates would be published in the next 
update to FAA Order JO 7400.11. FAA 
Order JO 7400.11K, which lists Class A, 
B, C, D, and E airspace areas, air traffic 
service routes, and reporting points, is 
publicly available as listed in the 
ADDRESSESsection of this document. 
The Proposal 
The FAA is proposing an amendment 
to 14 CFR part 71 that would modify the 
Class E airspace area designated as a 
surface area for an airport and the Class 
E airspace extending upward from 700 
feet above the surface at Ketchikan 
International Airport, Ketchikan, AK. 
An airspace evaluation was 
conducted to analyze the airspace 
containment of a new special procedure 
at the airport. The evaluation identified 
several areas where the airspace at 
Ketchikan was not providing the 
minimum containment necessary for 
IFR operations within surface and 
transitional Class E airspace. 
The Class E surface area airspace at 
the airport does not fully contain IFR 
departures until reaching the base of the 
next adjacent controlled airspace, nor 
does it fully contain the airport’s 
approach procedures when operating 
less than 1,000 feet above the surface, 
with the only exception being the Area 
Navigation (RNAV) (Global Positioning 
System [GPS])-B approach procedure. 
FAA Order JO 7400.2, Procedures for 
Handling Airspace Matters, provides 
airspace containment guidance, and 
states that Class E surface airspace may 
be designated to accommodate: 
instrument approach procedures and 
IFR arrival, departure, holding, and en 
route operations not protected by other 
controlled airspace. Operational and 
economical effects were discussed with 
Anchorage’s Air Route Traffic Control 
Center and Juneau Flight Service Station 
(Ketchikan’s servicing facilities) using 
FAA policy guidance for establishing 
and modifying Class E airspace areas. 
Neither facility desires an expansion of 
the Class E surface area airspace at 
Ketchikan International Airport based 
on multiple factors affecting the 
location. An expansion of the surface 
area would create communication issues 
in known radio blind spots east and 
southeast of the airport. Radio blind 
spots are not consistent with surface 
area placement, as communications 
capabilities must exist down to the runway surface of an airport, and 
neither direct nor relayed 
communications would exist in the 
identified radio blind spot areas at 
Ketchikan. Moreover, any expansion of 
the surface area could cause undesirable 
economic and operational impacts to 
the local community by blocking visual 
flight rules (VFR) access into/out of 
Ward’s Cove and Ketchikan’s City 
Center, amongst other areas. 
Additionally, a surface area expansion 
could lead to an expanded reliance on 
Special VFR clearances for VFR aircraft 
to operate into/out of/through an 
expanded surface area when weather 
conditions exist that would prevent 
flight in less-than-VFR weather. To 
supplant the lack of an expanded 
surface area, Ketchikan International 
Airport would continue to rely on its 
Special Air Traffic Rules (14 CFR part 
93 Subpart M), Instrument Flight 
Procedures, Visual Checkpoints, and 
Special VFR arrival/departure 
procedures that are all intended to 
contribute to the airport’s overall safety 
and efficiency. 
The airspace review conducted on 
Ketchikan International Airport also 
revealed that its transitional Class E 
airspace extending upward from 700 
feet above the surface (Class E5) is not 
sized properly to contain arriving IFR 
operations below 1,500 feet above the 
surface and departing IFR operations 
until reaching 1,200 feet above the 
surface. The area immediately 
surrounding the airport should be 
expanded to a 4.3-mile radius to better 
contain the circling portions of the 
Localizer (LOC) X Runway (RWY) 11, 
RNAV (GPS)-B, and RNAV (GPS)-C 
approach procedures. The northwestern 
portion of the Class E5 airspace should 
be expanded approximately 3 miles and 
lengthened approximately 10 miles to 
better contain arriving and departing 
IFR operations when utilizing the 
Instrument Landing System (ILS) Y or 
LOC Y RWY 11, LOC X RWY 11, and 
WIGUL ONE DEPARTURE instrument 
flight procedures. The southeast portion 
of the Class E5 airspace should be 
expanded by approximately 2 miles, 
lengthened by approximately 1 mile, 
and re-oriented to the south by 
approximately 10 degrees to better 
contain arriving and departing IFR 
operations when utilizing the ILS Y or 
LOC Y RWY 11, RNAV (GPS) RWY 11, 
ILS Z or LOC Z RWY 11, KETCHIKAN 
SIX DEPARTURE (Obstacle), ANNETTE 
THREE DEPARTURE (RNAV), DOOZI 
TWO DEPARTURE (RNAV), and 
UDENE THREE DEPARTURE (RNAV) 
procedures. Further transitional 
containment above 1,200 feet above the 
surface is provided by the ‘‘Southeast 
Class E6’’ airspace the extends upward 
from 1,200 feet above the surface. 
Lastly, the airspace review identified 
administrative errors within the 
Ketchikan Class E airspace legal 
descriptions. Ketchikan’s geographic 
location (airport reference point) should 
be updated to reflect the FAA’s 
database, and the airspace areas should 
be described using the updated location. 
If adopted, this change would create a 
negligible shift in the airspace’s lateral 
boundaries of approximately 700 feet. 
Additionally, Ketchikan’s Class E 
airspace areas are partly described in 
relation to the Ketchikan LOC. Any 
reference to its LOC should be removed 
as it is no longer needed to describe the 
airspace. Furthermore, the Ketchikan 
Class E Surface Area Airspace contains 
a cut-out at the northwestern portion of 
the airspace near Ward’s Cove that is

the five, only three of the listed points 
within the description’s text header are 
usable as a reference due to their 
respective geographic locations, and one 
point is listed within the description 
body instead of its text header. ‘‘East 
Island’’ and ‘‘Decoy Benchmark’’ should 
be removed as references, and the 
reference to the ‘‘Refuge Cove State 
Recreation Site Picnic Area’’ should be 
shortened to ‘‘Refuge Cove State 
Recreation Site’’ and moved from the 
description’s body to its text header. 
Regulatory Notices and Analyses 
The FAA has determined that this 
proposed regulation only involves an 
established body of technical 
regulations for which frequent and 
routine amendments are necessary to 
keep them operationally current. It, 
therefore: (1) is not a ‘‘significant 
regulatory action’’ under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ‘‘significant 
rule’’ under DOT Regulatory Policies 
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant 
preparation of a regulatory evaluation as 
the anticipated impact is so minimal. 
Since this is a routine matter that will 
only affect air traffic procedures and air 
navigation, it is certified that this 
proposed rule, when promulgated, will 
not have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
Environmental Review 
This proposal will be subject to an 
environmental analysis in accordance 
with FAA Order 1050.1G, FAA National 
Environmental Policy Act Implementing 
Procedures, prior to any FAA final 
regulatory action.

Implementation of the Administrative 
False Claims Act 
AGENCY: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 
ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is proposing to 
amend its regulations in order to fully 
implement the Administrative False 
Claims Act (AFCA), as amended by the 
Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense 
Authorization Act. This updated rule 
establishes clear and comprehensive 
administrative procedures for 
investigating, evaluating, and imposing 
civil penalties and monetary 
assessments on individuals or entities 
that knowingly make, submit, or present 
false claims, representations, or 
misleading statements to NASA. The 
AFCA offers a streamlined, agency-level 
enforcement remedy that enables NASA 
to more effectively address smaller, 
lower-dollar fraud cases, safeguard 
critical Federal funds, and strongly 
deter fraudulent conduct. 
DATES: NASA must receive comments on or before February 13, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments, identified by RIN 2700–AE79 through 
the Federal eRulemaking Portal: https:// 
www.regulations.gov. Follow the online instructions for submitting comments. 
All comments received will be posted 
without change to the Federal 
eRulemaking Portal; including any 
personal information provided.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
On December 23, 2024, the National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 
Fiscal Year 2025 (FY 2025 NDAA) (Pub. 
L. 118–159) was signed into law. Under 
section 5203, the FY 2025 NDAA 
revitalizes an existing but underutilized 
fraud enforcement mechanism: the 
Administrative False Claims Act of 2023 
(AFCA). This Act, previously known as 
the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act 
of 1986, offers a streamlined 
administrative remedy for addressing 
false claims and statements that the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) opts not to 
prosecute. The new statute requires

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61110 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules amendment to the NASA’s regulations 
at 14 CFR 1264 within 180 days of 
enactment. The AFCA complements the 
more widely known and widely used 
civil False Claims Act by providing an 
administrative process by which Federal 
executive branch agencies can address 
relatively small dollar value false claims 
that might not warrant the attention of 
the DOJ. The liability provisions of the 
AFCA remain closely modeled on those 
in the False Claims Act. The principal 
differences between the False Claims 
Act and the AFCA are that the AFCA 
does not include a qui tam enforcement 
mechanism, covers false written 
statements even in the absence of a 
claim, and provides for administrative 
rather than judicial resolution. 
II. Regulatory Analysis 
Executive Order (E.O.) 12866— 
Regulatory Planning and Review, E.O. 
13563—Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review, and E.O. 14192— 
Unleashing Prosperity Through 
Deregulation 
E.O.s 12866 and 13563 direct agencies 
to assess all costs and benefits of 
available regulatory alternatives and, if 
regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety effects, distributive impacts, 
and equity). E.O. 13563 emphasizes the 
importance of quantifying both costs 
and benefits of reducing costs, of 
harmonizing rules, and of promoting 
flexibility. This rule is a significant 
regulatory action under E.O. 12866. This 
rule is expected to be an E.O. 14192 
deregulatory action. 
E.O. 13132—Federalism 
E.O. 13132 requires agencies to ensure 
meaningful and timely input by state 
and local officials in the development of 
regulatory policies that may have a 
substantial, direct effect on the states, 
on the relationship between the 
National Government and the states, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. This action has 
been analyzed in accordance with the 
principles and criteria contained in the 
order, and NASA has determined that 
this action will not have a substantial 
direct effect or federalism implications 
on the states and would not preempt 
any state law or regulation or affect the 
states’ ability to discharge traditional 
state governmental functions. Therefore, 
consultation with the states is not 
necessary. 
E.O. 13175—Consultation and 
Coordination With Indian Tribal 
Governments 
This final rule has been analyzed in 
accordance with the principles and 
criteria contained in E.O. 13175. NASA 
has determined that the removal of 
Subpart 1204.3 does not significantly or 
uniquely affect the communities of the 
Indian tribal governments or impose 
substantial direct compliance costs on 
them; the funding and consultation 
requirements of E.O. 13175 do not 
apply. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
Because no notice of proposed 
rulemaking is required, the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act does not require an 
initial or final regulatory flexibility 
analysis.
1
 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
No collections of information 
pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction 
Act are contained in the final rule. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 
This rule will not impose a Federal 
mandate that may result in the 
expenditure by state, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector, of $100 million or more 
in any one year.

Safety Zone; Rocket Test Site, Rio 
Grande River, Boca Chica, TX 
AGENCY: Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a permanent safety zone for 
certain navigable waters of the Rio 
Grande River. The safety zone is needed 
to protect personnel, vessels, and the 
marine environment from potential 
hazards created by cryogenics and 
structural tests of SpaceX rockets at 
their Massey’s test site. This proposed 
rulemaking would prohibit persons and 
vessels from being in the safety zone 
unless specifically authorized by the 
Captain of the Port, Sector Corpus 
Christi. We invite your comments on 
this proposed rulemaking. 
DATES: Comments and related material must be received by the Coast Guard on 
or before January 29, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: To submit comments and view available documents, go to the 
Federal Docket Management System at 
https://www.regulations.gov and search for USCG–2025–0898.

NASA National Aeronautics and Space

§ Section 
SpaceX Space Exploration Technologies 
Corporation 
U.S.C. United States Code 
II. Background and Authority 
The Coast Guard has long monitored 
commercial spaceflight activities 
impacting the maritime domain and 
taken actions to ensure the safety of 
vessels, persons, and the marine 
environment. In conducting this 
activity, the Coast Guard engages with 
other government agencies, including 
the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) and the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA), and 
private space operators, including Space 
Exploration Technologies Corporation 
(SpaceX). Through this engagement, the 
Coast Guard became aware of an area 
within the Rio Grande River, known as 
the Massey’s Test Site, which SpaceX 
uses for pre-launch static fire test 
operations. Potential hazards from 
activities at this site include accidental 
discharge of cryogenic fuel and test 
failures resulting in dangerous 
projectiles and falling hot embers or 
other debris. SpaceX conducts these 
tests weekly, with plans to increase test 
frequency. Testing frequency may be as 
often as daily by the end of 2025. 
The Captain of the Port Sector Corpus 
Christi (COTP) has determined that 
potential hazards associated with static 
fire tests are a safety concern for anyone 
on the Rio Grande River within a half 
mile of the test site. While SpaceX does 
follow certain safety protocols during 
these tests, which include ensuring the 
area around the test site on the Rio 
Grande River is clear, the Coast Guard 
believes that a legally enforceable safety 
zone will provide a greater measure of 
safety. Therefore, the COTP is proposing 
this rule under the authority in 46 
U.S.C. 70034, to protect personnel and 
vessels in the navigable waters within 
the safety zone. The regulatory text we 
are proposing appears at the end of this 
document. 
III. Discussion of the Rule 
This proposed rule would establish a 
safety zone that would be activated 
during times when rocket testing is 
conducted. The safety zone would cover 
all navigable waters within a half mile 
radius of the testing facility. No vessel 
or person would be permitted to enter 
the safety zone without obtaining 
permission from the COTP or their 
designated representative. The 
regulatory text we are proposing appears 
at the end of this document. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
We developed this proposed rule after 
considering numerous statutes and 
Executive orders related to rulemaking. 
Below we summarize our analyses 
based on a number of these statutes and 
Executive orders. 
A. Impact on Small Entities 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 
1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, 
requires Federal agencies to consider 
the potential impact of regulations on 
small entities during rulemaking. The 
term ‘‘small entities’’ comprises small 
businesses, not-for-profit organizations 
that are independently owned and 
operated and are not dominant in their 
fields, and governmental jurisdictions 
with populations of less than 50,000. 
Section 605 of the RFA allows an 
agency to certify a rule, in lieu of 
preparing an analysis, if the rulemaking 
is not expected to have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The Coast 
Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) 
that this proposed rule would not have 
a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities for 
the following reasons. 
The area of the Rio Grande River that 
will be impacted by this safety zone is 
a shallow water area with little to no 
regular commercial or recreational 
vessel traffic. While it will not be 
possible to transit around the safety 
zone, any vessels needing to transit 
through this area will only be delayed 
for short periods of time as the zone will 
be activated immediately before a test 
operation, and will be cancelled once 
the operation is safely completed. The 
expected duration of each safety zone 
activation is between 4–6 hours. The 
Coast Guard will issue public advisories 
in advance of each safety zone 
activation so that persons transiting 
through this area on the Rio Grande may 
plan accordingly. 
If you think that your business, 
organization, or governmental 
jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity 
and that this proposed rule would have 
a significant economic impact on it, 
please submit a comment (see 
ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it 
qualifies and how and to what degree 
this proposed rule would economically 
affect it. 
Under section 213(a) of the Small 
Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), 
if this proposed rule will affect your 
small business, organization, or 
governmental jurisdiction and you have 
questions, contact the person listed in 
the 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT 
section. Small businesses may send 
comments to the Small Business and 
Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement 
Ombudsman and the Regional Small 
Business Regulatory Fairness Boards by 
calling 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734– 
3247). 
B. Collection of Information 
This proposed rule will not call for a 
new collection of information under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. 3501–3520).

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS61113 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Proposed Rules C. Federalism and Indian Tribal 
Governments 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Executive Order 13132, 
Federalism, and have determined that it 
is consistent with the fundamental 
federalism principles and preemption 
requirements described in that Order. 
Also, this proposed rule does not have 
tribal implications under Executive 
Order 13175, Consultation and 
Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, because it does not have 
a substantial direct effect on one or 
more Indian tribes, on the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
Indian tribes, or on the distribution of 
power and responsibilities between the 
Federal Government and Indian tribes. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
As required by The Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531–1538), the Coast Guard certifies 
that this proposed rule will not result in 
an annual expenditure of $100,000,000 
or more (adjusted for inflation) by a 
State, local, or tribal government, in the 
aggregate, or by the private sector. 
E. Environment 
We have analyzed this proposed rule 
under Department of Homeland 
Security Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, 
associated implementing instructions, 
and Environmental Planning 
COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which 
guide the Coast Guard in complying 
with the National Environmental Policy 
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and 
have determined that this action is one 
of a category of actions that do not 
individually or cumulatively have a 
significant effect on the human 
environment. 
This proposed rule is a safety zone. It 
is categorically excluded from further 
review under paragraph L60(a) of 
Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction 
Manual 023–01–001–01, Rev. 1. A 
preliminary Record of Environmental 
Consideration supporting this 
determination is available in the docket. 
V. Public Participation and Request for 
Comments 
We view public participation as 
essential to effective rulemaking and 
will consider all comments and material 
received during the comment period. 
Your comment can help shape the 
outcome of this rulemaking. If you 
submit a comment, please include the

720–0291 or email 
Anthony.T.Goodeman@usda.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As required by section 21 of the USGSA (7 
U.S.C. 87j), as amended, the Secretary of 
Agriculture (Secretary) established the 
Advisory Committee on September 29, 
1981, to provide advice to the AMS 
Administrator on implementation of the 
USGSA. As specified in the USGSA, no 
member may serve, successively, for 
more than 2 terms. 
The Advisory Committee consists of 
15 members, appointed by the 
Secretary, who represent the interests of 
grain producers, processors, handlers, 
merchandisers, consumers, exporters, 
and scientists with expertise in research 
related to the policies in section 2 of the 
USGSA (7 U.S.C. 74). While members of 
the Advisory Committee serve without 
compensation, USDA reimburses them 
for travel expenses, including per diem 
in lieu of subsistence, for travel away 
from their homes or regular places of 
business in performance of Advisory 
Committee service (see 5 U.S.C. 5703). A list of current Advisory Committee 
members and other relevant information 
are available on the USDA website at: 
https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/ 
facas-advisory-councils/giac. 
The grain industry utilizes official 
inspection and weighing services for 
barley, canola, corn, flaxseed, oats, rye, 
soybeans, sorghum, sunflower seed, 
triticale, wheat, and mixed grain at 
various points throughout the marketing 
chain. AMS is seeking nominations for 
the Advisory Committee that will reflect 
the varied interest and experience from 
these different sectors of the grain 
industry from producer to exporter, 
including, but not limited to, grain 
producers, processors, merchandisers, 
handlers, exporters, consumers, grain 
inspection agencies and scientists. 
Therefore, when making 
recommendations for appointments, the 
industry must consider the varied 
interests of the population served and 
the knowledge, skills, and abilities of 
the members to serve a range of 
stakeholders. 
USDA programs are prohibited from 
discriminating based on race, color, 
national origin, religion, sex, disability, 
age, marital status, family/parental 
status, income derived from a public 
assistance program, political beliefs, or 
reprisal or retaliation for prior civil 
rights activity, in any program or 
activity conducted or funded by USDA 
(not all bases apply to all programs). 
Remedies and complaint filing 
deadlines vary by program or incident. 
Persons with disabilities who require 
alternative means of communication for 
program information (e.g., Braille, large print, audiotape, American Sign 
Language) should contact the 
responsible Agency or USDA’s TARGET 
Center at (202) 720–2600 (voice and 
TTY) or contact USDA through the 
Federal Relay Service at (800) 877–8339. 
Additionally, program information may 
be made available in languages other 
than English. 
Equal opportunity practices in 
accordance with USDA’s policies will 
be followed in all appointments to the 
Committee. USDA is an equal 
opportunity provider, employer, and 
lender. 
The final selection of Advisory 
Committee members is made by the 
Secretary.

budget; the Standard Forms SF–424 
series, and SF–LLL, which request basic 
information, budget information, and 
disclosure of lobbying activities 
certification, respectively. In addition, 
grantees must submit SF–906, Grant 
Program Accounting System and 
Financial Capability Questionnaire. 
Grantees will also be required to submit 
Standard Form SF–425, Federal 
Financial Report form, and the FNS– 
908, Performance Progress Report form. 
If FNS decides to use the uniform 
grant application package, FNS will 
note in the grant solicitation that 
applicants must use the uniform grant 
application package and that the 
information collection has already been 
approved by OMB. If FNS chooses not 
to use the uniform grant application 
package or finds it necessary for grant 
applicants to submit extra information 
not included in the uniform package, 
FNS will issue a notice of at least 30 
days inviting public comments on its 
plan to gather different or additional 
information be making a grant 
solicitation, unless this has already been 
addressed in earlier published notices. 
Need and Use of the Information: The 
primary users of the information 
collected from the applicant are FNS 
and other Federal staff who will serve 
on a panel to systematically review, 
evaluate, and approve the competitive 
and non-competitive grant/cooperative 
agreement applications and recommend 
the applicants most likely to meet 
program objectives and most responsive 
to the solicitation. The selection criteria 
will be contained in the Request for 
Application package. Without this 
information, FNS will not have 
adequate data to select appropriate 
grantees or evaluate which grants 
should be continued or monitor 
financial reporting requirements.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
Submission for OMB Review; 
Comment Request 
The Department of Agriculture has 
submitted the following information 
collection requirement(s) to OMB for 
review and clearance under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 
Public Law 104–13. Comments are 
requested regarding; whether the 
collection of information is necessary 
for the proper performance of the 
functions of the agency, including 
whether the information will have 
practical utility; the accuracy of the 
agency’s estimate of burden including 
the validity of the methodology and 
assumptions used; ways to enhance the 
quality, utility and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on those who are to 
respond, including through the use of 
appropriate automated, electronic, 
mechanical, or other technological 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology. 
Comments regarding this information 
collection received by January 29, 2026 
will be considered. Written comments 
and recommendations for the proposed 
information collection should be 
submitted within 30 days of the 
publication of this notice on the 
following website www.reginfo.gov/

Food and Nutrition Service 
Title: 7 CFR part 215—Special Milk Program for Children. 
OMB Control Number: 0584–0005. 
Summary of Collection: Section 3 of 
the Child Nutrition Act (CNA) (P.L. 89– 
642, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 1772) 
authorizes the Special Milk Program 
(SMP) for Children. It provides for 
appropriation of such sums as may be 
necessary to enable the Secretary of 
Agriculture, under such rules and 
regulations as the Secretary may deem 
in the public interest, to encourage 
consumption of fluid milk by children 
in the United States in (1) nonprofit 
schools of high school grade and under, 
and (2) nonprofit nursery schools, child 
care centers, settlement houses, summer 
camps, and similar nonprofit 
institutions devoted to the care and 
training of children, which do not 
participate in a food service program 
authorized under the CAN. Section 10 
of the CNA (42 U.S.C. 1779) requires the 
Secretary of Agriculture to ‘‘prescribe 
such regulations as the Secretary may 
deem necessary to carry out this Act’’ 
and pursuant to that provision, the 
Secretary has issued 7 CFR part 215 
which contains the policies and 
procedures for the administration and 
operation of the SMP. For this revision, 
FNS estimates that the burden for the 
collection will decrease due to fewer 
State agencies, such as School Food 
Authorities (SFA), and Non-Profit Child 
Care Institutions (CCI) participating in 
the program. 
Need and Use of the Information: 
This is a revision of the currently 
approved information collection. This is 
an ongoing collection that contains both 
mandatory and required to obtain or 
retain benefit requirements. The SMP is 
administered at the State, SFA, and CCI 
levels. In accordance with the 
regulations, State and local operators are 
required to collect information

National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture 
Title: NIFA Proposal Review Process. OMB Control Number: 0524–0041. 
Summary of Collection: The United 
States Department of Agriculture 
(USDA), National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture (NIFA), administers 
competitive, peer-reviewed research, 
education and extension programs. The 
reviews are undertaken to ensure that 
projects supported by NIFA are of a 
high-quality and are consistent with the 
goals and requirements of the funding 
program. These programs are authorized 
pursuant to the authorities contained in 
the National Agricultural Research, 
Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 
1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 3101), the 
Smith-Lever Act, and other legislative 
authorities. 
Need and Use of the Information: The 
information collected from the 
evaluations is used to support NIFA 
grant programs. NIFA uses the results of 
each proposal to determine whether a 
proposal should be declined or 
recommended for award. To obtain this 
information, an electronic questionnaire 
is used to collect information about 
potential panel and ad-hoc reviewers. 
To ensure the highest quality of funded 
research, NIFA must collect reviews in 
a timely manner and on an individual 
application basis. If this information 
was not collected and documented, the 
decision to fund a particular application 
could be questioned.

Needs and Uses: Over the years, the 
Bureau of Industry and Security has 
worked with other Government agencies 
and the affected public to identify areas 
where export licensing requirements 
may be relaxed without jeopardizing 
U.S. national security or foreign policy. 
Many of these relaxations have taken 
the form of licensing exceptions, as well 
as other types of authorizations or 
exclusions; BIS is revising the title of 
this collection of information to more 
accurately reflect the scope and 
language of the Export Administration 
Regulations. Some of these license 
exceptions and other authorizations 
have a reporting or recordkeeping 
requirement to enable the Government 
to continue to monitor exports of these 
items. Exporters may choose to utilize 
the license exception and accept the 
reporting or recordkeeping burden in 
lieu of submitting a license application. 
These exceptions and other 
authorizations have resulted in a large 
reduction of licensing burden in OMB 
Control No. 0694–0088 and allow 
exporters to ship less sensitive items 
quicker, without having to wait for 
license approval.

Commerce. 
ACTION: Notification of standard ex- vessel prices. 
SUMMARY: NMFS publishes standard ex- vessel prices for groundfish and halibut 
for the calculation of the observer fee 
under the North Pacific Observer 
Program (Observer Program). This 
notice is intended to provide 
information to vessel owners, 
processors, registered buyers, and other 
Observer Program participants about the 
standard ex-vessel prices that will be 
used to calculate the Observer Program 
fee associated with landings of 
groundfish and halibut made in 2026. 
NMFS will send invoices to processors 
and registered buyers subject to the fee 
by January 15, 2027. Fees are due to 
NMFS on or before February 15, 2027. 
DATES: The standard prices take effect on January 1, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Additional information about the Observer Program is available 
on NMFS Alaska Region’s website at 
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/

and halibut fisheries. Fishery managers 
use information collected by observers 
and EM to monitor quotas, manage 
groundfish and prohibited species 
catch, and document and reduce fishery 
interactions with protected resources. 
Scientists use observer-collected 
information for stock assessments and 
marine ecosystem research. 
The Observer Program includes two 
observer coverage categories: the partial 
coverage category and the full coverage 
category. All groundfish and halibut 
vessels and processors subject to 
observer coverage are included in one of 
these two categories. Defined at 
§ 679.51, the partial coverage category
includes vessels and processors that are
not required to have an observer or EM
at all times when fishing, and the full
coverage category includes vessels and
processors required to have all of their
fishing and processing activity
observed. Vessels and processors in the
full coverage category arrange and pay
for observer services from a permitted
observer provider. Observer coverage
and EM for the partial coverage category
is funded through a system of fees based
on the ex-vessel value of groundfish and
halibut. Throughout this notice, the
term ‘‘processor’’ refers to shoreside
processors, stationary floating
processors, and catcher/processors in
the partial coverage category.
Landings Subject to Observer Coverage 
Fee 
Pursuant to section 313 of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act, 
NMFS is authorized to assess a fee on 
all landings accruing against a Federal 
total allowable catch (TAC) for 
groundfish or commercial halibut quota 
landings made by vessels that are 
subject to Federal regulations and not 
included in the full coverage category. 
A fee is only assessed on landings of 
groundfish from vessels designated on a 
Federal Fisheries Permit or from vessels 
landing individual fishing quota (IFQ) 
or community development quota 
(CDQ) halibut or IFQ sablefish. Within 
the subset of vessels subject to the 
observer fee, only landings accruing 
against an IFQ allocation or a Federal 
TAC for groundfish are included in the 
fee assessment. A table with additional 
information about which landings are 
subject to the observer fee is at 
§ 679.55(c) and on page 2 of an
informational bulletin titled ‘‘Observer
Fee Collection’’ that can be downloaded
from the NMFS Alaska Region website
at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/observer-fee- 
collection-north-pacific-groundfish-and- 
halibut-fisheries-observer. 
Fee Determination 
A fee equal to 1.65 percent of the ex- 
vessel value is assessed on the landings 
of groundfish and halibut subject to the 
fee. Ex-vessel value is determined by 
multiplying the standard price for 
groundfish by the round weight 
equivalent for each species, gear, and 
port combination, and the standard 
price for halibut by the headed and 
gutted weight equivalent. Standard 
prices are determined by aggregating 
prices by species, gear, and area 
grouping to arrive at an average price 
per pound for each grouping. NMFS 
reviews each vessel landing report and 
determines whether the reported 
landing is subject to the observer fee 
and, if so, which groundfish species in 
the landing are subject to the observer 
fee. All IFQ or CDQ halibut in a landing 
subject to the observer fee will be 
included in the observer fee calculation. 
For any landed groundfish or halibut 
subject to the observer fee, NMFS will 
apply the appropriate standard ex-vessel 
prices for the species, gear type, and 
port and calculate the observer fee 
associated with the landing. 
Processors and registered buyers can 
access the landing-specific, observer fee 
information through the NMFS Web 
Application (https://alaskafisheries.
noaa.gov/webapps/efish/login) or 
eLandings (https://elandings.
alaska.gov/). Landing-specific observer 
fee information is either available 
immediately or within 24 hours after a 
landing report is submitted 
electronically. A time lag occurs for 
some landings because NMFS must 
process each landing report through the 
catch accounting system to determine 
which groundfish in a landing accrues 
against a Federal TAC and are subject to 
the observer fee. 
Under the fee system, catcher vessel 
owners split the fee with the registered 
buyers or owners of shoreside or 
stationary floating processors. While the 
owners of catcher vessels and 
processors in the partial coverage 
category are each responsible for paying 
their portion of the fee, the owners of 
shoreside or stationary floating 
processors and registered buyers are 
responsible for collecting the fees from 
catcher vessels and remitting the full fee 
to NMFS. Owners of catcher/processors 
in the partial coverage category are 
responsible for remitting the full fee to 
NMFS. 
NMFS sends invoices to processors 
and registered buyers by January 15 of 
each calendar year. The total fee amount 
is determined by the sum of the fees 
reported for each landing at that 
processor or registered buyer in the 
prior calendar year. Processors and 
registered buyers must pay the fees to 
NMFS using eFISH. Payments are due 
by February 15 of each year. Processors 
and registered buyers have access to this 
system through a User ID and password 
issued by NMFS. Instructions for 
electronic payment are provided on the 
NMFS Alaska Region website at https:// 
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/
commercial-fishing/observer-fee- 
collection-and-payment-north-pacific- 
groundfish-and-halibut and on the observer fee invoice to be mailed to each 
processor and registered buyer. 
Standard Prices 
This notification provides the 
standard ex-vessel prices for groundfish 
and halibut species subject to the 
observer fee in 2026. Data sources for 
ex-vessel prices include the following: 
€For groundfish other than sablefishIFQ and sablefish accruing against the 
fixed gear sablefish CDQ reserve, the 
State of Alaska’s Commercial Fishery 
Entry Commission’s (CFEC) gross 
revenue data, which are based on the 
Commercial Operator Annual Report 
(COAR) and Alaska Department of Fish 
and Game (ADF&G) fish tickets; and 
€For halibut IFQ, halibut CDQ,sablefish IFQ, and sablefish accruing 
against the fixed gear sablefish CDQ 
reserve, the IFQ Buyer Report that is 
submitted to NMFS annually by each 
registered buyer that operates as a 
shoreside processor and receives and 
purchases IFQ landings of sablefish and 
halibut or CDQ landings of halibut 
under § 679.5(l)(7)(i). 
The standard prices in this 
notification were calculated using the 
following procedures for protecting 
confidentiality of data submitted to or 
collected by NMFS. NMFS does not 
publish any price information that 
would permit the identification of an 
individual or business. For NMFS to 
publish a standard price for a particular 
species-gear-port combination, the price 
data used to calculate the standard price 
must represent landings from at least 
four different vessels delivered to at 
least three different processors in a port 
or port group. NMFS has aggregated 
price data that are confidential because 
fewer than four vessels or three 
processors contributed data to a 
particular species-gear-port 
combination.

then dividing total ex-vessel value over 
the 3-year period in each category by 
total volume over the 3-year period in 
each category. This calculation results 
in an average ex-vessel price per pound 
by species, port, and gear category for 
the 3-year period. Three gear categories 
were used for the standard ex-vessel 
prices: (1) non-trawl gear, including 
hook-and-line, pot, jig, troll, and others 
(Non-Trawl); (2) non-pelagic trawl gear 
(NPT); and (3) pelagic trawl gear (PTR). 
CFEC ex-vessel value and volume 
data are available in the fall of the year 
following the year the fishing occurred. 
Thus, it is not possible to base ex-vessel 
fee liabilities on standard prices that are 
less than 2 years old. For the 2026 
groundfish standard ex-vessel prices, 
the most recent ex-vessel value and 
volume data available are from 2024. 
If a particular groundfish species is 
not listed in table 1, the standard ex- 
vessel price for a species group (if it 
exists in the management area) will be 
used. If price data for a particular 
species remained confidential once 
aggregated to the outside of Alaska 
(ALL) level, data are aggregated by 
species group (Flathead Sole; GOA 
Deep-water Flatfish; GOA Shallow- 
water Flatfish; GOA Skate, Other; and 
Other Rockfish). Standard prices for the 
groundfish species groups are shown in 
table 2. 
If a port-level price does not meet the 
confidentiality requirements, the data 
are aggregated by port group. Port-group 
data for Southeast Alaska (SEAK) and 
the Eastern GOA excluding Southeast 
Alaska (EGOAxSE) also are presented 
separately when price data are available. 
Port-group data are aggregated by 
regulatory area in the GOA (Eastern 
GOA, Central GOA, and Western GOA) 
and by subarea in the BSAI (BS subarea 
and AI subarea). If confidentiality 
requirements are still not met by 
aggregating prices across ports at these 
levels, the prices are aggregated at the 
level of BSAI or GOA, then statewide 
(AK) and ports outside of Alaska 
(OTAK), and finally all ports, including 
those outside of Alaska (ALL). 
Standard prices are presented 
separately for non-pelagic trawl and 
pelagic trawl when non-confidential 
data are available. NMFS also calculated 
prices for a ‘‘Pelagic Trawl/Non-pelagic 
Trawl Combined’’ (PTR/NPT) category 
that can be used when combining trawl 
price data for landings of a species in a 
particular port or port group will not 
violate confidentiality requirements. 
Creating this standard price category 
allows NMFS to assess a fee on 2026 
landings of some of the species with 
pelagic trawl gear based on a combined 
trawl gear price for the port or port 
group. If confidentiality requirements 
are still not met with the PTR/NPT 
category, fixed and trawl gear prices are 
combined for an all-gear price. 
If no standard ex-vessel price is listed 
for a species or species group and gear 
category combination in table 1, table 2, 
or table 3, no fee will be assessed on 
that landing. Volume and value data for 
that species will be added to the 
standard ex-vessel prices in future 
years, if the data become available and 
display of a standard ex-vessel price 
meets confidentiality requirements.

I. Abstract 
This is a request for renewal of an 
approved information collection. The 
collection is sponsored by the National

This collection contains collection-of- 
information requirements necessary for 
the transfer of License Limitation 
Program (LLP) licenses for the 
commercial groundfish, crab, and 
scallop fisheries. The purpose of this 
collection is to determine whether a 
transfer is eligible and if endorsements 
meet regulatory requirements for 
licensing and permits. An essential 
feature of the LLP is the ability for 
participants to transfer their LLP 
license. Without the ability to track the 
movement of LLP licenses, NMFS 
would be unable to effectively manage 
the LLP and administer the Pacific Cod 
Trawl Cooperative (PCTC) Program. The 
LLP restricts access to the commercial 
groundfish, crab, and scallop fisheries 
in the exclusive economic zone off 
Alaska, except for certain areas where 
alternative programs exist. The intended 
effect of the LLP is to limit the number 
of participants and reduce fishing 
capacity in fisheries off Alaska. More 
information on the LLP can be found on 
the NMFS Alaska Region website and at 
50 CFR part 679. 
An LLP license is required for vessels 
participating in directed fishing for LLP 
groundfish species in the Bering Sea 
and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) or Gulf of 
Alaska (GOA), or fishing in any BSAI 
LLP crab fisheries. An LLP license is 
also required for any vessel deployed in 
scallop fisheries in Federal waters off 
Alaska except for some diving 
operations. 
Vessels participating in directed 
fishing for LLP groundfish species in the 
GOA or BSAI, or fishing in any BSAI 
LLP crab fisheries, must be named on a 
valid copy of the LLP license that is on 
board the vessel, with some exceptions. 
An LLP groundfish or crab license 
authorizes the license holder to deploy 
the vessel in fisheries in accordance 
with the specific area and species 
endorsements, the vessel and gear 
designations, the maximum length 
overall (MLOA) specified on the license, 
and any exemption from the MLOA 
specified on the license. 
An LLP scallop license authorizes the 
person named on the license to catch 
and retain scallops in compliance with 
State of Alaska regulations using a 
vessel that does not exceed the MLOA 
specified on the license and the gear 
designation specified on the license. 
Unlike the LLP groundfish license, the 
scallop license is not vessel specific. A 
valid copy of the LLP scallop license 
must be on board the vessel. 
For program definitions, refer to 50 
CFR 679.2, for permit and licensing 
requirements for scallop refer to 50 CFR 
679.4(g), for permit and licensing 
requirements for groundfish and crab 
refer to 50 CFR 679.4(k), for PCTC 
Program refer to 50 CFR 679 subpart L, 
and for prohibitions refer to 50 CFR 
679.7(i). Additional information on the 
LLP can be found on the NMFS Alaska 
Region website at https://www.fisheries.
noaa.gov/alaska/sustainable-fisheries/ 
license-limitation-program-alaska. 
This collection contains the 
Application for the transfer of 
groundfish and crab LLP licenses, the 
Application for the transfer of scallop 
LLP licenses, and the Transfer appeal. 
The applications for transfers are each 
filled by two respondents, the transferor 
and the transferee. The type of 
information collected includes 
information on the transferor, transferee, 
and the LLP license to be transferred, as 
well as information on the quota share 
to be transferred, the vessel currently 
named on the LLP license, the vessel to 
be named on the LLP license, and the 
ownership interest and transaction data. 
Information is collected as needed by 
the respondent and is used to determine 
whether a transfer is eligible and if 
endorsements meet regulatory 
requirements for licensing and permits. 
All of the forms can now be submitted 
electronically via email. There are no 
other changes to this collection. 
II. Method of Collection 
The applications are available as 
fillable PDFs on the NMFS Alaska 
Region website and may be downloaded 
and emailed, printed, faxed, or 
delivered. The Application for the 
transfer of groundfish and crab LLP 
licenses is found at https://

Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission 
[Docket No. CP26–233–000] 
Mangum Gas Storage LLC; Notice of 
Availability of the Environmental 
Assessment for the Proposed 2025 
Amendment Project 
Any person wishing to comment on 
the EA may do so. To ensure 
consideration of your comments on the 
proposal prior to making a decision on 
the project, it is important that the 
Commission receive your comments on 
or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 20, 2026. Instructions for filing 
comments are provided on page 3. 
The proposed project is an 
amendment to the Certificate of Public 
Convenience and Necessity (Certificate) 
issued by the Commission on March 17, 
2011, as amended on November 17, 
2016, and on April 23, 2020, in Docket 
Nos. CP10–22–000, CP16–18–000, and 
CP20–77–000, respectively. Currently, 
Magnum is authorized to construct and 
operate a natural gas storage facility 
with a total working gas capacity of 21 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) consisting of two 
storage caverns, one brine disposal pond 
and associated facilities, compression 
facilities, a 61.6-mile-long, 36-inch- 
diameter header pipeline, and other 
related facilities. The proposed 
modifications consist primarily of 
changes to the locations of previously 
approved facilities and utilities at the 
storage site. Magnum also requests 
authorization to redesign two 
authorized caverns for 5.2 Bcf of 
working gas each and to construct and 
operate two additional storage caverns 
with 5.2 Bcf of working gas capacity 
each, one additional brine disposal 
pond and related facilities, and two new 
pipeline interconnections. Magnum’s 
stated purpose is to modify its 
Certificate to reflect new construction, 
operational and commercial needs, and 
provide new competitive firm and 
interruptible natural gas storage, hub, 
and wheeling services in the Western 
United States. 
The EA assesses the potential 
environmental effects of the 
Amendment Project in accordance with 
the requirements of the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The 
FERC staff concludes that approval of 
the Amendment Project would not 
constitute a major federal action 
significantly affecting the quality of the 
human environment. 
The Amendment Project includes the 
following facilities within the storage 
site: 
€four below-ground, solution mined storage caverns (CW–3, CW–4, CW–25, 
and CW–26); 
€two water supply wells (GS–MH–4 and GS–MH–5); 
€compression, substation, and dehydration and metering facilities; 
€two large-scale brine evaporation ponds (Pond 3 and Pond 5); 
€maintenance and laydown area; €office/warehouse building; €site-wide utility corridors containing water, brine and power lines; 
€portions of the 4-inch-diameter, about 9-mile-long gas supply line 
connected to the local gas distribution 
company; 
€portions of the 36-inch-diameter, about 61.5 mile long header pipeline 
(Header) and associated block valves 
that extend from the Storage Site near 
Delta in Millard County to the interstate 
pipeline system near Goshen in Utah

Availability of Environmental 
Assessment 
In accordance with the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and 
the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission’s (Commission) 
regulations, 18 CFR part 380, the Office 
of Energy Projects has reviewed the 
application for license for a subsequent 
license to continue to operate and 
maintain the Shenandoah Project No. 
2509 (project). The project is located on 
the South Fork of the Shenandoah River 
near the Town of Shenandoah in Page 
and Rockingham, Counties, Virginia. 
Commission staff has prepared an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) for the 
project.

The EA contains staff’s analysis of the 
potential environmental impacts of the 
project and concludes that licensing the 
project, with appropriate environmental 
protective measures, would not 
constitute a major federal action that 
would significantly affect the quality of 
the human environment. 
The Commission provides all 
interested persons with an opportunity 
to view and/or print the EA via the 
internet through the Commission’s 
Home Page (http://www.ferc.gov/), using

is no fee or cost for filing protests, 
motions to intervene, or comments. The 
deadline for filing protests, motions to 
intervene, and comments is 5:00 p.m.

Protests 
Pursuant to section 157.205 of the 
Commission’s regulations under the 
NGA,
1
any person
2
or the Commission’s 
staff may file a protest to the request. If 
no protest is filed within the time 
allowed or if a protest is filed and then 
withdrawn within 30 days after the 
allowed time for filing a protest, the 
proposed activity shall be deemed to be 
authorized effective the day after the

filed and not withdrawn within 30 days 
after the time allowed for filing a 
protest, the instant request for 
authorization will be considered by the 
Commission.

regulations,
3
and must be submitted by 
the protest deadline, which is 5:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on February 17, 2026. A 
protest may also serve as a motion to

Commission’s orders in the U.S. Circuit 
Courts of Appeal. 
To intervene, you must submit a 
motion to intervene to the Commission 
in accordance with Rule 214 of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure
4
and the regulations under 
the NGA
5
by the intervention deadline 
for the project, which is 5:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on February 17, 2026. As 
described further in Rule 214, your 
motion to intervene must state, to the 
extent known, your position regarding 
the proceeding, as well as your interest 
in the proceeding. For an individual, 
this could include your status as a 
landowner, ratepayer, resident of an 
impacted community, or recreationist. 
You do not need to have property 
directly impacted by the project in order 
to intervene. For more information 
about motions to intervene, refer to the 
FERC website at https://www.ferc.gov/ 
resources/guides/how-to/intervene.asp. 
All timely, unopposed motions to 
intervene are automatically granted by 
operation of Rule 214(c)(1). Motions to 
intervene that are filed after the 
intervention deadline are untimely and 
may be denied. Any late-filed motion to 
intervene must show good cause for 
being late and must explain why the 
time limitation should be waived and 
provide justification by reference to 
factors set forth in Rule 214(d) of the 
Commission’s Rules and Regulations. A 
person obtaining party status will be 
placed on the service list maintained by 
the Secretary of the Commission and 
will receive copies (paper or electronic) 
of all documents filed by the applicant 
and by all other parties. 
Comments 
Any person wishing to comment on 
the project may do so. The Commission 
considers all comments received about 
the project in determining the 
appropriate action to be taken. To 
ensure that your comments are timely 
and properly recorded, please submit 
your comments on or before 5:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on February 17, 2026. The 
filing of a comment alone will not serve 
to make the filer a party to the 
proceeding. To become a party, you 
must intervene in the proceeding. 
How To File Protests, Interventions, and

protests, motions to intervene, and 
comments. In both instances, please

Hydroelectric Project No. 2425 (project). 
The project is located on the South Fork 
of the Shenandoah River near the 
Towns of Luray (Luray Development) 
and Newport (Newport Development) in 
Page County, Virginia. Commission staff 
has prepared an Environmental 
Assessment (EA) for the project.

The EA contains staff’s analysis of the 
potential environmental impacts of the 
project and concludes that licensing the 
project, with appropriate environmental 
protective measures, would not 
constitute a major federal action that 
would significantly affect the quality of 
the human environment. 
The Commission provides all 
interested persons with an opportunity 
to view and/or print the EA via the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61144 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices Abstract: The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the 
regulations published at 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart BB were proposed on 
September 24, 1976, promulgated on 
February 23, 1978, and amended on 
April 4, 2014. These regulations apply 
to the following facilities at existing 
kraft pulp mills that commenced 
construction, reconstruction, or 
modification after September 24, 1976 
and on or before May 23, 2013: recovery 
furnaces, smelt dissolving tanks, lime 
kilns, digester systems, brown stock 
washer systems, black liquor oxidation 
systems, multiple effect evaporator 
systems and condensate stripper 
systems. In pulp mills where kraft 
pulping is combined with neutral sulfite 
semi-chemical pulping, the provisions 
of this subpart are applicable when any 
portion of the material charged to an 
affected facility is produced by the kraft 
pulping operation. This information is 
being collected to assure compliance 
with 40 CFR part 60, subpart BB. New 
facilities that commenced construction, 
modification or reconstruction after May 
23, 2013 are subject to regulation under 
40 CFR part 60 subpart BBa. 
In general, all NSPS standards require 
initial notifications, performance tests, 
and periodic reports by the owners/ 
operators of the affected facilities. They 
are also required to maintain records of 
the occurrence and duration of any 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction in 
the operation of an affected facility, or 
any period during which the monitoring 
system is inoperative. These 
notifications, reports, and records are 
essential. 
Form numbers: None. 
Respondents/affected entities: Kraft 
pulp mills. 
Respondent’s obligation to respond: 
Mandatory (40 CFR part 60, subpart BB). 
Estimated number of respondents: 85 
(total). 
Frequency of response: Initially, 
semiannually, annually. 
Total estimated burden: 12,100 hours 
(per year). Burden is defined at 5 CFR 
1320.3(b). 
Total estimated cost: $6,360,000 (per 
year), includes $4,700,000 annualized 
capital or operation & maintenance 
costs. 
Changes in the estimates: The 
adjustment decrease in burden from the 
most recently approved ICR is due to a 
decrease in the number of sources 
because of recent known facility 
closures. There is a slight increase in the 
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs 
due to O&M costs being updated from 
$2009 to $2023 using the CEPCI Index. 
There are no capital costs associated 
with this information collection.

Abstract: This ICR covers the information collection activities 
associated with the issuance of data- 
call-ins (DCIs) under section 3(c)(2)(B) 
of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). EPA 
regulates the use of pesticides under the 
authority of two federal statutes: FIFRA 
and the Federal Food, Drug and 
Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), both as 
amended by the Food Quality Protection 
Act (FQPA) of 1996. Before 
manufacturers can sell pesticides in the 
United States, EPA must evaluate the 
pesticides thoroughly to ensure that 
they meet federal safety standards to 
protect human health and the 
environment. EPA grants a 
‘‘registration’’ or license that permits a 
pesticide’s distribution, sale, and use 
only after the company meets the 
scientific and regulatory requirements. 
In evaluating a pesticide registration 
application, EPA assesses a wide variety 
of potential human health and 
environmental effects associated with 
the use of the product. Applicants, or 
potential registrants, must generate or 
provide the scientific data necessary to 
address concerns pertaining to the 
identity, composition, potential adverse

pesticide. The data allows EPA to 
evaluate whether a pesticide has the 
potential to cause harmful effects to 
human health and the environment, 
including effects to non-target 
organisms, federally threatened and 
endangered (listed) species, and to 
surface water or ground water. Through 
a rigorous scientific and public process, 
EPA specifies the kinds of data and 
information necessary to make 
regulatory judgments about the risks 
and benefits of pesticide products under 
FIFRA section 3, 4 and 5, as well as the 
data and information needed to 
determine the safety of pesticide 
chemical residues under FFDCA section 
408. The regulations in 40 CFR part 158 
describe the minimum data and 
information EPA typically requires to 
support an application for pesticide 
registration or amendment; support the 
reregistration of a pesticide product; 
support the maintenance of a pesticide 
registration by means of the data call-in 
process (e.g., as used in the registration review program); or establish or 
maintain a tolerance or exemption from 
the requirements of a tolerance for a 
pesticide chemical residue.

Total estimated cost: $240,726,041 
(total), which includes $0 annualized 
capital or operation & maintenance 
costs. 
Changes in the estimates: There is a 
decrease of 7,194,896 hours in the total 
estimated respondent burden compared 
with the ICR currently approved by 
OMB. The number of Maintenance DCIs 
have increased by 45 and the number of 
estimated Registration Review DCIs 
have decreased by 227. The Agency has 
determined that Resistance Management 
Plan DCIs, will decrease from 237 to 1.

Abstract: The New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the 
regulations published at 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart DD were proposed on January 
18, 1977, and promulgated on August 3, 
1978. These regulations apply to 
existing facilities and new facilities 
located at grain elevators: each truck 
unloading station, truck loading station, 
railcar unloading station, railcar loading 
station, grain dryer, and all grain 
handling operations commencing 
construction, modification or 
reconstruction after August 3, 1978. 
This information is being collected to 
assure compliance with 40 CFR part 60, 
subpart DD. 
In general, all NSPS standards require 
initial notifications, performance tests, 
and periodic reports by the owners/ 
operators of the affected facilities. They 
are also required to maintain records of 
the occurrence and duration of any 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction in 
the operation of an affected facility, or 
any period during which the monitoring 
system is inoperative. These 
notifications, reports, and records are

operation & maintenance costs. 
Changes in the estimates: The 
increase in burden from the most 
recently approved ICR is due to an 
adjustment(s). The adjustment increase 
in burden from the most recently 
approved ICR is due to an increase in 
the estimated number of existing 
respondents. The previous ICR 
documented 200 sources, but after a 
current ECHO database search, the 
number of respondents estimated in this 
ICR is 254. The growth rate remains at

Respondents/affected entities: 
Respondents are manufacturers of 
nonroad engines within the following 
North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) code: 33618, 33612, 
336999, 336991, 333112, 335312. 
Respondent’s obligation to respond: 
The respondent’s obligation to respond 
is voluntary, but respondents who chose 
not to respond cannot obtain a 
Certificate of Conformity, and therefore 
cannot introduce their products into 
commerce in the U.S. 
Estimated number of respondents: 
393 (total). 
Frequency of response: Yearly for 
certification, production, ABT, and 
warranty reports. 
Total estimated burden: 1,390 hours 
(per respondent, per year). Burden is 
defined at 5 CFR 1320.3(b). 
Total estimated cost: $102,388,928.41 
(per year), includes $45,650,002.40 
annualized capital or operation & 
maintenance costs. 
Changes in the estimates: There is a 
decrease of 328 hours in the total 
estimated respondent burden compared 
with the ICR currently approved by 
OMB. This decrease is due largely to 
fewer respondents than the previous 
ICR and more manufacturers utilizing 
carrying over data from previous model 
years to demonstrate compliance with 
the standards.

Abstract: TSCA section 5 requires manufactures (which includes import) 
of a ‘‘new chemical substance’’ (i.e., a chemical not listed on the TSCA section 
8(b) Inventory) must provide a 
premanufacture notice (PMN) to EPA at 
least 90 days prior to commencing 
manufacture of that chemical and that 
EPA review such notice and take 
appropriate action. Under TSCA, the 
term ‘‘chemical substance’’ includes 
microorganisms; the 90-day notice for 
microorganisms is a Microbial 
Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN). 
Under TSCA section 5, EPA is 
authorized to determine that a use of a 
chemical substance is a significant new 
use and promulgate a significant new 
use rule (SNUR). In certain instances, 
persons may pursue a significant new 
use, thus they must submit a notice and 
undergo a review. TSCA section 5 
requires a significant new use notice 
(SNUN) from any person who proposes 
to manufacture or process a chemical for 
a use EPA determined to be a 
‘‘significant new use.’’ 
TSCA section 5 requires EPA to make 
one of five possible determinations 
before concluding its review of 
submitted notices about risk to human 
health & the environment from the 
manufacture, processing, distribution in 
commerce, use and/or disposal of new 
chemical substances or significant new 
uses. EPA’s determination on a new 
chemical substance or new use will 
dictate how and to what extent the 
chemical’s manufacture, processing, 
distribution, use, and/or disposal may 
be restricted. If EPA fails to make a 
timely determination, fees may be 
refunded; however, EPA’s obligation to 
make a determination remains. EPA 
requires the submitter of a PMN or 
MCAN inform EPA when non-exempt 
commercial manufacture of the 
substance in question begins by 
submitting a Notice of Commencement; 
EPA would then add the new chemical 
substance to the TSCA section 8(b) 
Inventory. 
Persons who intend to export a 
substance identified in a proposed or 
final SNUR are subject to the export 
notification provisions of TSCA section 
12(b), and regulations that interpret 
TSCA section 12(b) at 40 CFR part 707; 
and the associated paperwork activities 
and burdens approved under OMB 
Control No. 2070–0030 (EPA ICR No. 
0795.16), ‘‘Notification of Chemical 
Exports—TSCA Section 12(b)’’. 
Existing chemicals are chemicals 
already listed on the TSCA Inventory; 
and therefore ‘‘existing chemical 
SNURs’’ are often written to require 
notice for significant new uses of 
chemicals already in commerce. 
Form number(s): 7710–23, 7710–25, 
7710–56, 6300–7. 
Respondents/affected entities: 
Potentially affected entities include 
processors; e.g., entities identified by the North American Industrial 
Classification System (NAICS) codes 
325, Chemicals and Allied Products 
Manufacturers, and 324, Petroleum 
Refining. 
Respondent’s obligation to respond: 
Mandatory (CFR 720, 721, 723 & 725). 
Estimated number of respondents: 
4,234 (total). 
Frequency of response: On occasion. 
Total estimated burden: 128,367 
hours (per year). Burden is defined at 5 
CFR 1320.3(b). 
Total estimated cost: $45,183,758 (per 
year), which includes $0 annualized 
capital or operation & maintenance 
costs. 
Changes in the estimates: There is no 
change in the burden hours in the total 
estimated respondent burden compared 
with the ICR currently approved by 
OMB.

MAC Industries Inc. dba MAC 
Container Line, Complainant v. COSCO 
Shipping Lines Co., Ltd. and COSCO 
Shipping Lines (North America) Inc., 
Respondents; Notice of Filing of 
Complaint and Assignment 
Notice is given that a complaint has 
been filed with the Federal Maritime 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) by 
MAC Industries Inc. dba MAC Container 
Line (the ‘‘Complainant’’) against 
COSCO Shipping Lines Co., Ltd. and 
COSCO Shipping Lines (North America) 
Inc. (the ‘‘Respondents’’). Complainant 
states that the Commission has 
jurisdiction over the complaint pursuant 
to the Shipping Act, 46 U.S.C. 41301– 
41307; the Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
of 2022; and 46 CFR part 502 and 
jurisdiction over Respondents as a 
vessel-operating common carrier and its 
United States agent. 
Complainant is a non-vessel-operating 
common carrier organized and existing 
under the laws of the state of California 
with its principal place of business in 
San Clemente, California. 
Complainant identifies Respondent 
COSCO Shipping Lines Co., Ltd. as a 
vessel-operating common carrier 
organized and existing under the laws of 
the People’s Republic of China with its 
principal place of business in Shanghai, 
China whose agent in the United States 
is Respondent COSCO Shipping Lines 
(North America) Inc., a corporation with 
its principal place of business in 
Secaucus, New Jersey. 
Complainant alleges that Respondents 
violated 46 U.S.C. 41102(c) and 
41104(a)(2), (3), and (10). Complainant 
alleges these violations arose from 
Respondents’ unreasonable assessment 
of detention charges even after 
Respondents had taken control of the 
equipment in dispute, retaliatory 
actions against Complainant by way of 
refusing to accept future bookings, 
failure to meet service commitments in 
attempting to cancel a shipment without 
cause, and other acts or omissions by 
Respondents. 
An answer to the complaint must be 
filed with the Commission within 25 
days after the date of service. 
The full text of the complaint can be 
found in the Commission’s electronic 
Reading Room at https://www2.fmc.gov/ 
readingroom/proceeding/25-29/. This proceeding has been assigned to the 
Office of Administrative Law Judges. 
The initial decision of the presiding

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Proposed Project 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey— 
Household Component 
The Medical Expenditure Panel 
Survey (MEPS), which began in 1996, is 
a set of large-scale surveys of families 
and individuals, their medical providers 
(doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.), 
and employers across the United States. 
MEPS collects data on the specific 
health services that Americans use, how 
frequently they use them, the cost of 
these services, and how they are paid 
for, as well as data on the cost, scope, 
and breadth of health insurance held by 
and available to U.S. workers. MEPS 
data have become the linchpin for 
economic health care use and 
expenditures models. These data are 
vital in estimating the impact of changes 
in financing, coverage, and 
reimbursement policy on the U.S. 
healthcare system. No other survey 
provides the foundation for estimating 
the impact of changes in national policy 
on various segments of the U.S. 
population. These data continue to be 
essential for evaluating healthcare 
reform policies and analyzing the effect 
of tax code changes on healthcare 
expenditures and tax revenue. 
The MEPS-Household Component 
(HC) and Medical Provider Component 
(MPC) have the following goals: 
(1) To produce nationally 
representative estimates of health care 
use, expenditures, sources of payment, 
and health insurance coverage for the 
U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized 
population. 
(2) To produce nationally 
representative estimates of respondents’ 
health status, demographic and socio- 
economic characteristics, employment, 
access to care, and satisfaction with 
health care. 
Each year a new panel of sample 
households is selected. Recent annual 
MEPS–HC sample sizes average about 
10,350 households. Data can be 
analyzed at either the person, family, or 
event level. The panel design of the 
survey, which includes 5 Rounds of 
interviews covering 2 full calendar 
years, provides data for examining 
person level changes in selected 
variables such as expenditures, health 
insurance coverage, and health status. 
Using a combination of computer 
assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), 
computer assisted video interviewing 
(CAVI), and self-administered paper and 
web questionnaires, information about 
each household member is collected, 
and the survey builds on this 
information from interview to interview. 
CAVI is a newer data collection 
technology and offers the best of both 
telephone and in-person interviewing, 
while offering opportunities for cost 
savings and more accurate reporting. 
Proposed Revisions: This Information 
Collection Request (ICR) is for a revision 
to the previously approved information 
collection—0935–0118 Medical 
Expenditure Panel Survey—Household 
Component (MEPS–HC). 
These changes will be fielded in the 
Fall of 2026 and include: 
€MEPS–HC Core Interview—Minor changes to twenty-four questions 
include revising language to make the 
questions clearer for a better response 
rate. 
€MEPS Preventive Care Self- Administered Questionnaire (PSAQ): 
ÆRemoving four questions on counseling and treatment, one question 
about birth control, two questions about 
aspirin use, and two questions about 
gender. 
ÆReverting to the question used in the 2022 PSAQ about respondent sex. 
ÆReplacing two exercise items with five new items for exercise and strength 
training. 
ÆAdding questions about use of sleep medication, trouble getting to 
sleep, screen time, use of wearable 
devices, self-assessed diet quality, fruit 
and vegetable consumption, meals eaten 
away from home, former smoking, and 
weight loss attempt. 
ÆMinor changes in response categories to two questions. 
€Burdens and Economic Impacts of Medical Care Self-Administered 
Questionnaire (ESAQ) and Diabetes 
Care Supplement (DCS): Both will be 
discontinued. 
This study is being conducted by 
AHRQ through its contractors, Westat 
for the MEPS–HC and RTI for the 
MEPS–MPC, pursuant to AHRQ’s 
statutory authority to conduct and 
support research on health care and on 
systems for the delivery of such care, 42 
U.S.C. 299a(a)(1), and to conduct a 
survey on the cost, use, and quality of 
health care. 42 U.S.C. 299b–2. 
Method of Collection 
To achieve the goals of this project the 
following data collections will be 
implemented: 
Household Component—The MEPS– 
HC consists of a core interview 
administered to all sampled households, 
supplemental interviews administered 
to selected individuals, permission 
forms and a validation interview: 
(1) Core MEPS–HC Interview—All sampled households are administered 
the Core MEPS interview which collects 
health, health insurance, and 
employment data on all household 
members. 
(2) Adult Self-Administered Questionnaire (Adult SAQ)—Completed 
by all adults 18 and older in the 
household in rounds 2 and 4 in odd 
years. Collects a variety of health status 
and health care quality measures of 
adults age 18 and older. 
(3) Preventive Care Self-Administered Questionnaire (PSAQ)—Designed to 
collect a variety of person-level 
preventive health care data for adults 18 
years and older. 
(4) Authorization Forms for the MEPS–MPC Provider and Pharmacy 
Survey—Asks respondents for 
authorization to obtain supplemental 
information from their medical 
providers (hospitals, physicians, home 
health agencies and institutions) and 
pharmacies. 
(5) MEPS Validation Interview—Each interviewer is required to have at least 
15 percent of his/her caseload validated 
to ensure that Core questionnaire 
content was asked appropriately and 
procedures followed, for example, the 
use of show cards. In excess of this 
requirement, 100% of MEPS completes 
undergo validation efforts. Over 50% of 
cases are validated through the use of 
Westat’s Eagle system which tracks GPS 
coordinates, matching them to 
respondent addresses and interview 
times. Computer Assisted Recorded 
Interview (CARI) review accounts for 
roughly 40% of MEPS case validation 
where EAGLE is not appropriate (CAVI 
interviews) or is not valid or available. 
The audio and screen capture from 
numerous questions is evaluated to 
ensure an interviewer and a respondent, 
proper question administration and 
show card usage. For cases that cannot 
be validated using CARI or GPS, phone 
validations are conducted to ensure 
proper procedures and administration. 
Mail validations are used as a final 
measure when other types of validation 
have not resulted in a validated case.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61152 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices Medical Provider Component—Upon 
completion of the household interview 
and obtaining permission from the 
household survey respondents, a sample 
of medical providers and pharmacies 
are contacted by telephone to obtain 
information that household respondents 
cannot accurately provide. This part of 
the MEPS is called the Medical Provider 
Component (MPC) and information is 
collected on dates of visits, diagnosis 
and procedure codes, charges and 
payments for medical providers, and for 
pharmacies: dates of fills, ndc (or drug 
name, strength, dosage), quantity and 
days supplied, and payments. The MPC 
includes data collections for specific 
types of health care providers and 
pharmacies. There are no changes to the 
MPC data collection.

(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520), federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for each 
collection of information they conduct 
or sponsor. The term ‘‘collection of 
information’’ is defined in 44 U.S.C. 
3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or 
requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. 
Interested persons are invited to send 
comments regarding our burden 
estimates or any other aspect of this 
collection of information, including the 
necessity and utility of the proposed 
information collection for the proper 
performance of the agency’s functions, 
the accuracy of the estimated burden, 
ways to enhance the quality, utility, and 
clarity of the information to be 
collected, and the use of automated 
collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology to minimize the 
information collection burden. 
Information Collection 
1. Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a currently approved collection; Title of 
Information Collection: Manufacturer 
Submission of Average Sales Price 
(ASP) Data for Medicare Part B Drugs 
and Biologicals and Supporting 
Regulations in 42 CFR 414.800–806; 
Use: The revisions in this iteration are associated with our November 5, 2025 
(90 FR 49266) CY 2026 Physician Fee 
Schedule (PFS) final rule (CMS–1832–F, 
OMB 0938–AV50). In this Federal 
Register notice we are soliciting public comment on the subject ASP collection 
of information request that is set out in 
the aforementioned supporting 
statement and associated attachments 
(see 
DATESand ADDRESSESfor details). 
This solicitation for public review and 
comment is an additional comment 
period that is specific to the 
aforementioned supporting statement 
and attachments. This notice provides 
an additional 60-day comment period 
that will not be supplemented with a 
subsequent 30-day notice or comment 
period. 
The CY 2026 PFS final rule revised 
§ 414.804(a)(5) adding submission 
requirements for ASP data reporting to 
include: (1) reasonable assumptions for 
calculating the manufacturer’s ASP, 
including a summary of the 
methodology used to determine fair 
market value for fee arrangements as 
described at § 414.804 and (2) warranty 
or certification letter from the recipient 
of a fee from a manufacturer as evidence 
that a fee was not passed on in 
accordance with submission 
requirements at § 414.804. 
Currently, in the absence of specific 
guidance in statute or Federal 
regulations, the manufacturer may make 
reasonable assumptions in its 
calculations of the manufacturer’s ASP, 
consistent with the general 
requirements and intent of the law, 
Federal regulations, and the 
manufacturer’s customary business 
practices. The reasonable assumptions 
explain the methodology used by the 
manufacturer to calculate ASP. 
The rule specifies that for sales 
beginning January 1, 2026, the 
reasonable assumptions document, 
which is currently submitted 
voluntarily by some manufacturers 
along with ASP data, is a required 
component of the quarterly ASP data 
submission. The warranty or 
certification from the recipient of a bona 
fide service fee is a new document that 
we finalized to be required as evidence 
of whether or not a fee was passed on. 
As discussed in the final rule, the new 
requirements are effective for sales 
occurring on or after January 1, 2026; 
that data would be due to CMS by April 
30, 2026, and used in the July 2026 
Medicare Part B Drug Payment Limit 
File.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) 
(44 U.S.C. 3501–3520), federal agencies 
must obtain approval from the Office of

collection of information they conduct

3502(3) and 5 CFR 1320.3(c) and 
includes agency requests or 
requirements that members of the public 
submit reports, keep records, or provide 
information to a third party. Section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the PRA (44 U.S.C. 
3506(c)(2)(A)) requires federal agencies 
to publish a 30-day notice in the 
Federal Register concerning each 
proposed collection of information, 
including each proposed extension or 
reinstatement of an existing collection 
of information, before submitting the 
collection to OMB for approval. To 
comply with this requirement, CMS is 
publishing this notice that summarizes 
the following proposed collection(s) of 
information for public comment. 
1. Type of Information Collection Request: Extension of a currently approved information collection; Title 
of Information Collection: Medicare 
Coverage of Items and Services in FDA 
Investigational Device Exemption 
Clinical Studies; Use: Section 1862(m) of the Social Security Act (and 
regulations at 42 CFR Subpart B 
(sections 405.201–405.215) allows for 
payment of the routine costs of care 
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries in a 
Category A investigational device 
exemption (IDE) study and authorizes 
the Secretary to establish criteria to 
ensure that Category A IDE trials 
conform to appropriate scientific and 
ethical standards. Medicare does not 
cover the Category A device itself 
because Category A (Experimental) 
devices do not satisfy the statutory 
requirement that Medicare pay for 
devices determined to be reasonable and 
necessary. Medicare may cover Category 
B (Non-experimental) devices, and 
associated routine costs of care, if they 
are considered reasonable and necessary 
and if all other applicable Medicare 
coverage requirements are met. 
Under the current centralized review 
process, interested parties (such as 
study sponsors) that wish to seek 
Medicare coverage related to Category A 
or B IDE studies have a centralized 
point of contact for submission, review 
and determination of Medicare coverage 
IDE study requests. In order for CMS (or 
its designated entity) to determine if the 
Medicare coverage criteria are met, as 
described in our regulations, CMS (or its 
designated entity) must review 
documents submitted by interested 
parties or study sponsors. Such 
information submitted will be a FDA 
IDE approval letter, IDE study protocol, 
IRB approval letter, National Clinical 
Trials (NCT) number, and Supporting 
materials as needed. Form Number: 
CMS–10511 (OMB control number: 
0938–1250); Frequency: Yearly; Affected Public: Private Sector (Business or other for-profits, Not-for-Profit Institutions); 
Number of Respondents: 118 Total Annual Responses: 118; Total Annual Hours: 236. (For policy questions regarding this collection contact Xiufen

Announcement of the Intent To Award 
a Sole-Source Cooperative Agreement 
to the Welcoming Initiative for 
Newcomers in San Diego, CA 
AGENCY: Refugee Program Bureau, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), 
Administration for Children and 
Families (ACF), Department of Health 
and Human Services (HHS). 
ACTION: Notice of Issuance of a Single- Source Cooperative Agreement. 
SUMMARY: ACF, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) announces the 
intent to award a single-source 
cooperative agreement in the amount of 
up to $1,000,000 to the Welcoming 
Initiative for Newcomers (WIN) in San 
Diego, CA to conduct a baseline 
assessment of state readiness and 
capacity to implement a state-centered 
refugee resettlement framework under 
the Program of Initial Resettlement. The 
purpose is to empower states with the 
tools and insights needed to take control 
of their refugee resettlement 
recommendations. This nationwide 
baseline assessment will strengthen 
each state’s capacity to implement a 
state-centered refugee resettlement 
framework and will include a 
nationwide baseline assessment of state 
readiness and capacity, including a 
nationwide readiness map, state 
capacity catalog, and implementation 
roadmap. The baseline will also include 
state-specific labor force shortages and 
corresponding industries. 
DATES: The proposed period of performance is January 5, 2026 to 
September 29, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) intends 
to conduct a nationwide State Capacity 
and Readiness Assessment to support 
implementation of the Program of Initial

tools, data structures, and partnerships 
necessary for states to assess and 
communicate their capacity and 
infrastructure related to refugee 
placement. The assessment will include

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61156 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices development of standardized tools, 
structured interviews with state 
officials, focus groups to gather 
additional perspectives, and state-by- 
state analyses addressing housing 
availability, labor market conditions, 
education systems, and staffing. The 
resulting readiness map and roadmap 
will enable states to provide 
recommendations with greater precision 
and timeliness and will support ORR in 
considering those recommendations 
consistent with the requirements of 
section 412(a)(2) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2)). 
ORR proposes to issue a single-source 
cooperative agreement to the 
Welcoming Initiative for Newcomers 
(WIN) to complete this work. WIN 
possesses long-standing partnerships 
with State Refugee Coordinators, 
resettlement agencies, and community 
organizations across all 50 states and 
has expertise in labor market analysis, 
credential transferability, economic 
inclusion, and large-scale assessment 
design. These qualifications position 
WIN to rapidly engage state partners 
and produce a comprehensive readiness 
assessment within the required 
timeframes. 
This initiative is intended to support 
state and local preparedness in advance 
of PIR implementation by strengthening 
data readiness, capacity analysis, and 
systems alignment. The assessment will 
help ensure that state recommendations 
reflect local conditions and that 
placement decisions account for 
housing, workforce, and social service 
capacity. The activity supports 
evidence-based decision making, 
intergovernmental coordination, and 
effective administration of refugee 
resettlement activities. 
Statutory Authority: Under section 8 
U.S.C. 1522(b)(1) of the Refugee Act, 
ORR is authorized to make grants to and 
contracts with public or private 
nonprofit agencies for the initial 
resettlement of refugees in the United 
States. This action further advances the 
intent of 8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(2) by creating 
mechanisms through which ORR can, to 
the maximum extent possible, 
incorporate state recommendations into 
refugee placement and capacity 
planning decisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of this meeting is given under the 
authority of the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act, Title 5 U.S.C., ch. 10. 
The Commercial Customs Operations 
Advisory Committee (Committee) 
provides advice to the Secretary of the 
Department of Homeland Security, the 
Secretary of the Department of the 
Treasury, and the Commissioner of U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection on 
matters pertaining to the commercial 
operations of U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection and related functions within 
the Department of Homeland Security 
and the Department of the Treasury. 
The Committee is committed to 
ensuring all participants have equal 
access regardless of disability status. If 
you require reasonable accommodation 
due to a disability to fully participate, 
please contact Mrs. Latoria Martin at 
(202) 344–1440 as soon as possible. 
Please feel free to share this 
information with other interested 
members of your organization or 
association. 
To facilitate public participation, we 
are inviting public comments on the 
issues the Committee will consider prior 
to the formulation of recommendations 
as listed in the Agenda section below. 
There will be a public comment 
period after each subcommittee update 
during the meeting on January 14, 2026. 
During the meeting, comments may be 
submitted via the trade events mailbox 
at tradeevents@cbp.dhs.gov or through the Microsoft Teams chat feature. Please 
note the public comment period for 
speakers may end before the time 
indicated on the schedule that is posted 
on the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection web page: http://
www.cbp.gov/trade/stakeholder- 
engagement/coac. 
Agenda 
With the sunset of the traditional 
subcommittees and working groups after 
the September public meeting, a change 
in structure for the Committee was 
expected. However, close to the onset of 
the new fiscal year, the ability for the 
Committee to meet was affected by the 
lapse in funding of the Federal 
Government. While U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection was able to continue 
to work, the members of the Committee 
had no engagement with U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection during that time. 
Despite that, the Committee has been 
able to generate conversation for 
communications on new and existing 
Section 232 tariffs and the importance 
of the definitions for determining dates 
that affect all modes of transportation 
from import through to export. The 
Committee believes that 
recommendations could be possible for 
the January Committee meeting relating 
to Section 232 tariff implementation, 
but more conversation will be needed 
with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection to articulate the focus for 
meetings beyond this quarter.

Determination Pursuant to Section 102 
of the Illegal Immigration Reform and 
Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, 
as Amended 
AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, Department of Homeland Security. 
ACTION: Notice of determination. SUMMARY: The Secretary of Homeland Security has determined, pursuant to 
law, that it is necessary to waive certain 
laws, regulations, and other legal 
requirements in order to ensure the 
expeditious construction of barriers and 
roads in the vicinity of the international 
land border in the state of Texas. 
DATES: This determination takes effect on December 30, 2025. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Important mission requirements of the Department 
of Homeland Security (‘‘DHS’’) include 
border security and the detection and 
prevention of illegal entry into the 
United States. Border security is critical 
to the nation’s national security. 
Recognizing the critical importance of 
border security, Congress has mandated 
DHS to achieve and maintain 
operational control of the international 
land border. Secure Fence Act of 2006, 
Public Law 109–367, section 2, 120 Stat.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61159 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices unlawful entries into the United States, 
including entries by terrorists, other 
unlawful aliens, instruments of 
terrorism, narcotics, and other 
contraband. Id. Consistent with that mandate, the President’s Executive 
Order on Securing Our Borders directs 
that I take all appropriate action to 
deploy and construct physical barriers 
to ensure complete operational control 
of the southern border of the United 
States. Executive Order 14165, section 3 
(Jan. 20, 2025). 
Congress has provided to the 
Secretary of Homeland Security a 
number of authorities necessary to carry 
out DHS’s border security mission. One 
of those authorities is found at section 
102 of the Illegal Immigration Reform 
and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 
1996, as amended (‘‘IIRIRA’’). Public 
Law 104–208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009– 
546, 3009–554 (Sept. 30, 1996) (8 U.S.C. 
1103 note), as amended by the REAL ID 
Act of 2005, Public Law 109–13, Div. B, 
119 Stat. 231, 302, 306 (May 11, 2005) 
(8 U.S.C. 1103 note), as amended by the 
Secure Fence Act of 2006, Public Law 
109–367, section 3, 120 Stat. 2638 (Oct. 
26, 2006) (8 U.S.C. 1103 note), as 
amended by the Department of 
Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 
2008, Public Law 110–161, Div. E, Title 
V, section 564, 121 Stat. 2090 (Dec. 26, 
2007). In section 102(a) of IIRIRA, 
Congress provided that the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall take such 
actions as may be necessary to install 
additional physical barriers and roads 
(including the removal of obstacles to 
detection of illegal entrants) in the 
vicinity of the United States border to 
deter illegal crossings in areas of high 
illegal entry into the United States. In 
section 102(b) of IIRIRA, Congress 
mandated that in carrying out the 
authority of section 102(a), I provide for 
the installation of additional fencing, 
barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and 
sensors to achieve and maintain 
operational control of the border. 
Finally, in section 102(c) of IIRIRA, 
Congress granted to the Secretary of 
Homeland Security the authority to 
waive all legal requirements that I, in 
my sole discretion, determine necessary 
to ensure the expeditious construction 
of barriers and roads authorized by 
section 102 of IIRIRA. 
Determination and Waiver 
Section 1 
The United States Border Patrol Del 
Rio Sector is an area of high illegal 
entry. Between fiscal year 2021 and 
fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol 
apprehended over 1,410,330 illegal 
aliens attempting to enter the United 
States between border crossings in the 
Del Rio Sector. In that same time period 
Border Patrol seized over 277 pounds of 
marijuana, over 198 pounds of cocaine, 
over 353 pounds of methamphetamine, 
and over five pounds of fentanyl. 
Since the President took office, DHS 
has delivered the most secure border in 
history. More can and must be done, 
however. As the statistics cited above 
demonstrate, the Del Rio Sector is an 
area of high illegal entry where illegal 
aliens regularly attempt to enter the 
United States and smuggle illicit drugs, 
and given my mandate to achieve and 
maintain operational control of the 
border, I must use my authority under 
section 102 of IIRIRA to install 
additional barriers and roads in the Del 
Rio Sector. Therefore, DHS will take 
immediate action to construct 
additional barriers and roads in a 
segment of the border in the Del Rio 
Sector. The segment where such 
construction will occur is referred to 
herein as the ‘‘project area,’’ which is 
more specifically described in Section 2 
below. 
Section 2 
I determine that the following area in 
the vicinity of the United States border, 
located in the state of Texas within the 
U. S. Border Patrol Del Rio Sector, is an 
area of high illegal entry (the ‘‘project 
area’’): Starting at approximately GPS 
point 29.449888, ¥101.058072 and 
extending south and east to 
approximately GPS point 29.084630, 
¥100.663800. 
There is presently an acute and 
immediate need to construct additional 
physical barriers and roads in the 
vicinity of the border of the United 
States in order to prevent unlawful 
entries into the United States in the 
project area pursuant to section 102(a) 
and 102(b) of IIRIRA. In order to ensure 
the expeditious construction of 
additional physical barriers and roads in 
the project area, I have determined that 
it is necessary that I exercise the 
authority that is vested in me by section 
102(c) of IIRIRA. 
Accordingly, pursuant to section 
102(c) of IIRIRA, I hereby waive in their 
entirety, with respect to the 
construction of physical barriers and 
roads (including, but not limited to, 
accessing the project areas, creating and 
using staging areas, the conduct of 
earthwork, excavation, fill, and site 
preparation, and installation and 
upkeep of physical barriers, roads, 
supporting elements, drainage, erosion 
controls, safety features, lighting, 
cameras, and sensors) in the project 
area, all of the following statutes, 
including all federal, state, or other 
laws, regulations, and legal 
requirements of, deriving from, or 
related to the subject of, the following 
statutes, as amended: The National

Receipt of Incidental Take Permit 
Application and Proposed Habitat 
Conservation Plan for Piraeus Point 
Project, City of Encinitas, CA; 
Categorical Exclusion 
AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. 
ACTION: Notice of availability; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: We, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announce receipt of 
an application from Lennar Homes of 
California, LLC (applicant) for an 
incidental take permit (ITP) under the 
Endangered Species Act (ESA). The 
applicant requests the ITP to take the 
federally threatened coastal California 
gnatcatcher incidental to construction of 
the Piraeus Point Project, in the City of 
Encinitas, San Diego County, California. 
We request public comment on the 
application, which includes the 
applicant’s proposed habitat 
conservation plan (HCP), and on the 
Service’s preliminary determination that 
the proposed permitting action may be 
eligible for a categorical exclusion 
pursuant to the National Environmental 
Policy Act (NEPA), Department of the 
Interior’s (DOI) NEPA regulations, and 
the DOI Departmental Manual (DM). To 
make this preliminary determination, 
we prepared a joint draft environmental 
action statement and low-effect 
screening form, both of which are 
available for public review. We invite 
comment from the public and local, 
State, Tribal, and Federal agencies. 
DATES: We must receive your written comments on or before January 29, 
2026.

should use the relay services offered

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), 
have received an application from 
Lennar Homes of California, LLC 
(applicant) for a 10-year ITP for one 
covered species pursuant to section 
10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA, as amended (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). The application 
addresses the potential ‘‘take’’ of the 
threatened coastal California 
gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica 
californica; gnatcatcher) associated with the construction of the Piraeus Point 
Project in the City of Encinitas, San 
Diego County, California. 
We request public comment on the 
application, which includes the 
applicant’s HCP, and on the Service’s 
preliminary determination that this 
proposed ITP qualifies as ‘‘low effect’’ 
and may qualify for a categorical 
exclusion pursuant to DOI’s NEPA 
regulations (43 CFR part 46), and the 
DOI’s DM (516 DM 1, DOI NEPA 
Handbook appendix 2, 8.5 C.(2)). To 
make this preliminary determination, 
we prepared a joint draft environmental 
action statement and low-effect 
screening form which are available for 
public review. 
Background 
The Service listed the gnatcatcher as 
threatened on March 30, 1993 (58 FR 
16742) and published a revised final 
rule designating critical habitat on 
December 19, 2007 (72 FR 72010). 
Section 9 of the ESA prohibits take of 
fish and wildlife species listed as 
endangered (16 U.S.C. 1538). 
Under the ESA, ‘‘take’’ is defined to 
include the following activities: ‘‘to 
harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, 
wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or 
to attempt to engage in any such 
conduct’’ (16 U.S.C. 1532). Section 4(d) 
of the ESA allows the Secretary of the 
Interior to extend protections for 
endangered species to those listed as 
threatened. 
Under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA 
(16 U.S.C. 1539(a)(1)(B)), we may issue 
permits to authorize take of listed fish 
and wildlife species that is incidental 
to, and not the purpose of, carrying out 
an otherwise lawful activity. 
Regulations governing incidental take 
permits for threatened species are in the 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 50 
CFR 17.32. Issuance of an ITP also must 
not jeopardize the existence of federally 
listed fish, wildlife, or plant species, 
pursuant to section 7 of the ESA and 50 
CFR 402.02. The permittee would 
receive assurances under our ‘‘No 
Surprises’’ regulations (50 CFR 
17.32(b)(5)). 
Proposed Project 
The proposed project site includes a 
5.99 acres (ac) development footprint in 
a 6.88 ac undeveloped property located 
east of Piraeus Street and north of Plato 
Place, and 0.68 ac street vacation along 
portions of Piraeus Street and Plato 
Place, in the City of Encinitas, in San 
Diego County, California. The proposed 
Piraeus Point project includes the 
construction of 134 residential units 
spread across 14 three-story residential 
buildings, a pool, pool house, lounge 
seating, and 6.41 ac of land set aside 
(1.46 ac onsite and 4.95 ac offsite) as a 
biological open space preserve in the 
City of Encinitas, California. 
The applicant requests a 10-year ITP 
under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA. If 
we approve the permit, the applicant 
anticipates taking gnatcatcher resulting 
from impacts to the project site, 
including about 2.64 ac of native coastal 
sage scrub vegetation that this species 
uses for breeding, feeding, and 
sheltering. The take would be incidental 
to the applicant’s activities associated 
with the construction of the Piraeus 
Point project.

contains measures to minimize the

gnatcatcher. During construction, a 
Service-approved biological monitor 
will be present to ensure avoidance and 
minimization measures are understood 
by the contractors and implemented as 
anticipated. Impacts to preserved 
vegetation adjacent to the project 
footprint will be avoided by surveying, 
staking, and fencing the limits of 
proposed impacts and controlling 
erosion, sedimentation, and pollution 
within the footprint of impacts. 
Vegetation removal will occur outside 
the breeding season to avoid active 
nests, and impacts to productivity will 
be minimized by limiting construction 
within 500 feet of an active nest. 
The applicant proposes restore 1.59 ac 
of non-native vegetation to coastal sage 
scrub within the adjacent off-site 
preserve. In total, 6.41 ac of coastal sage 
scrub habitat for the coastal California 
gnatcatcher will be conserved through a 
biological conservation easement, with 
funding secured in a non-wasting 
endowment account, to ensure 
management and monitoring in 
perpetuity. 
Proposed Action and Alternatives 
The proposed action consists of the 
issuance of an ITP to address the 
incidental take of gnatcatchers from 
implementing the proposed HCP. To 
comply with the requirements for an 
HCP under ESA section 10(a), 
alternatives to the project and the 
incidental take of gnatcatcher were 
evaluated. 
Under the no project/no development 
alternative, the project would not be 
constructed, and no ITP would be 
issued. The applicant would have no 
use of the privately owned property. 
Under the reduced development 
footprint alternative, the 2.64 ac of 
coastal sage scrub gnatcatcher habitat 
onsite would be avoided. The 
gnatcatcher habitat consists of 2.64 ac of 
coastal sage scrub and southern mixed/ 
maritime chaparral habitat in two main 
patches in the northern and center 
portion of the project site. Therefore, the 
total avoidance of habitat would also 
prevent any reasonable economic use of 
the site. With implementation of the 
project, the development would be 
situated primarily in the southern 
portion of the project site. A 1.46 ac 
preserve would be established in the 
northern portion of the project site, and 
an off-site preserve of 4.95 ac would be 
preserved in perpetuity. 
The applicant selected the project as 
proposed over these alternatives 
because it achieves the project’s primary 
goal of providing housing, is financially 
feasible to implement, and would result 
in the preservation, restoration, and 
management of coastal California 
gnatcatcher habitat and prevent it from 
being further degraded. 
Our Preliminary Determination 
The Service made a preliminary 
determination that the applicant’s HCP 
would have minor or negligible effects 
on the gnatcatcher. Therefore, we have 
preliminarily determined that the 
proposed ESA section 10(a)(1)(B) ITP 
would be a low-effect ITP that may 
qualify for application of a categorical 
exclusion pursuant to NEPA, DOI’s 
NEPA regulations, and the DOI DM. 
Please see the draft environmental 
action statement and low-effect 
screening form for more information. 
Next Steps 
The Service will evaluate the 
application and any comments received 
resulting from this notice to determine 
whether to issue the requested ITP. We 
will also conduct an intra-Service 
consultation pursuant to section 7 of the 
ESA to evaluate the effects of the 
proposed take. After considering the 
preceding and other matters, we will 
determine whether the permit issuance 
criteria of section 10(a)(1)(B) of the ESA 
have been met. If met, the Service will 
issue the permit to the applicant for 
incidental take of the gnatcatcher.

Background.—On November 24, 2025, 
the Commission determined that the 
domestic interested party group 
response to its notice of institution (90 
FR 28783, July 1, 2025) of the subject 
five-year reviews was adequate and that 
the respondent interested party group 
response was inadequate. The 
Commission did not find any other 
circumstances that would warrant 
conducting full reviews.
1
Accordingly, 
the Commission determined that it 
would conduct expedited reviews 
pursuant to section 751(c)(3) of the Act 
(19 U.S.C. 1675(c)(3)). 
For further information concerning 
the conduct of these reviews and rules 
of general application, consult the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure, part 201, subparts A and B 
(19 CFR part 201), and part 207, 
subparts A, D, E, and F (19 CFR part 
207). 
Staff report.—A staff report 
containing information concerning the 
subject matter of these reviews has been 
placed in the nonpublic record, and will 
be made available to persons on the 
Administrative Protective Order service 
list for these reviews on January 21, 
2026. A public version will be issued 
thereafter, pursuant to § 207.62(d)(4) of 
the Commission’s rules. 
Written submissions.—As provided in 
§ 207.62(d) of the Commission’s rules, 
interested parties that are parties to 
these reviews and that have provided 
individually adequate responses to the 
notice of institution,
2
and any party 
other than an interested party to these 
reviews may file written comments with 
the Secretary on what determination the 
Commission should reach in these 
reviews. Comments are due on or before 
5:15 p.m. January 26, 2026 and may not 
contain new factual information. Any 
person that is neither a party to these 
five-year reviews nor an interested party 
may submit a brief written statement 
(which shall not contain any new 
factual information) pertinent to these 
reviews by January 26, 2026. However, 
should the Department of Commerce 
(‘‘Commerce’’) extend the time limit for 
its completion of the final results of its 
reviews, the deadline for comments 
(which may not contain new factual 
information) on Commerce’s final 
results is three business days after the 
issuance of Commerce’s results. If 
comments contain business proprietary 
information (BPI), they must conform 
with the requirements of §§ 201.6, 
207.3, and 207.7 of the Commission’s 
rules. The Commission’s Handbook on 
Filing Procedures, available on the 
Commission’s website at https://
www.usitc.gov/documents/handbook_
on_filing_procedures.pdf, elaborates upon the Commission’s procedures with 
respect to filings. 
In accordance with §§ 201.16(c) and

by a party to these reviews must be 
served on all other parties to these 
reviews (as identified by either the 
public or BPI service list), and a 
certificate of service must be timely 
filed. The Secretary will not accept a 
document for filing without a certificate 
of service. 
Determinations.—The Commission 
has determined these reviews are 
extraordinarily complicated and 
therefore has determined to exercise its 
authority to extend the review period by 
up to 90 days pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 
1675(c)(5)(B).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On January 27, 2025, the Commission 
instituted this investigation based on a 
complaint filed by Schu¨tz Container 
Systems, Inc. of North Branch, New 
Jersey and Protechna S.A. of Fribourg, 
Switzerland (collectively, 
‘‘Complainants’’). 90 FR 8222–23 (Jan. 
27, 2025). The complaint, as 
supplemented, alleged violations of 
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended, 19 U.S.C. 1337 (‘‘section 
337’’), by reason of the infringement of 
certain claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 
9,718,581; 8,708,150; 8,919,562; 
8,567,626; 9,004,310; and 8,276,299. Id. 
The Commission’s notice of 
investigation named the following 
respondents: Jinshan; Sakura; Jielin; and 
Hebei Shijiheng Plastics, Co., Ltd., of 
Zhongjie Huanghua City, China (‘‘Hebei 
Shijiheng’’). Id. The Office of Unfair Import Investigations (‘‘OUII’’) was also 
named as a party in the investigation. 
Id. 
On April 22, 2025, the Commission 
terminated the investigation as to 
certain patent claims based on 
withdrawal of the complaint. See Order No. 9 (Apr. 2, 2025), unreviewed by 
Notice (Apr. 22, 2025). In addition, the 
Commission amended the complaint 
and notice of investigation to change the 
address of Hebei Shijiheng to the 
address where Hebei Shijiheng had been 
served with the complaint and notice of 
investigation. Order No. 10 (May 9, 
2025), unreviewed by Notice (May 28, 2025). 
On July 7, 2025, the Commission 
amended the complaint and notice of 
investigation to assert claims 1–3 and 5 
of the ’150 patent against respondent 
Jinshan and claims 1–3 of the ’150 
patent against respondent Sakura. Order 
No. 12 (June 13, 2025), unreviewed by

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61165 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices Comm’n Notice (July 7, 2025). The 
Commission found that good cause 
exists for the amendments because 
‘‘Complainants learned of additional 
infringing product models 
manufactured by Jinshan and Sakura 
after filing of the complaint.’’ Order No. 
12 at 3. 
On July 7, 2025, the Commission 
found respondent Hebei Shijiheng in 
default for failure to respond to the 
complaint and notice of investigation or 
an order to show cause (Order No. 11) 
issued on June 2, 2025. Order No. 13 
(June 17, 2025), unreviewed by Comm’n 
Notice (July 7, 2025). 
On September 11, 2025, Complainants 
filed a declaration pursuant to section 
337(g)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1337(g)(1)) and 
Commission Rule 210.16(c) (19 CFR 
210.16(c)) seeking immediate entry of 
relief against defaulting respondent 
Hebei Shijiheng. Specifically, 
Complainants request a limited 
exclusion order prohibiting entry into 
the United States of Hebei Shijiheng’s 
infringing articles. Complainants also 
request that the Commission set a bond 
of one hundred percent (100%) of the 
entered value of the infringing articles 
during the period of Presidential review. 
On November 18, 2025, Complainants 
and respondents Sakura, Jinshan, and 
Jielin filed respective joint unopposed 
motions to terminate the investigation 
with respect to those respondents based 
on a settlement agreement, consent 
order, and consent order stipulation. On 
November 28, 2025, OUII filed 
responses in support of granting the 
three joint motions. No other party filed 
a response to any of the three motions. 
On December 8, 2025, the presiding 
Chief ALJ issued the three subject IDs 
(Order Nos. 20, 21, and 22) granting the 
unopposed motions to terminate Sakura, 
Jinshan, and Jielin, respectively, from 
the investigation. See Order No. 20 (Dec. 8, 2025) (terminating Sakura); Order No. 
21 (Dec. 8, 2025) (terminating Jinshan); 
Order No. 22 (Dec. 8, 2025) (terminating 
Jielin). The IDs each find, respectively, 
that the proposed consent order 
stipulations and consent orders conform 
to Commission Rule 210.21(c)(3), (4) (19 
CFR 210.21(c)(3), (4)). The IDs also find, 
respectively, that the statutory public 
interest factors do not weigh against 
entry of the proposed consent orders. 
No party filed a petition for review of 
any of the three subject IDs. 
The Commission has determined not 
to review any of the three subject IDs 
(Order Nos. 20, 21, 22). Accordingly, 
consent orders are issued to respondents 
Sakura, Jinshan, and Jielin, and this 
investigation is terminated with respect 
to remaining active respondents. As 
noted above, respondent Hebei 
Shijiheng was previously found in 
default. 
In connection with the final 
disposition of this investigation as to 
defaulting respondent Hebei Shijiheng, 
the statute authorizes issuance of: (1) an 
exclusion order that could result in the 
exclusion of the subject articles from 
entry into the United States, and/or (2) 
a cease and desist order that could 
result in the respondent being required 
to cease and desist from engaging in 
unfair acts in the importation and sale 
of such articles. Accordingly, the 
Commission is interested in receiving 
written submissions that address the 
form of remedy, if any, that should be 
ordered. If a party seeks exclusion of an 
article from entry into the United States 
for purposes other than entry for 
consumption, the party should so 
indicate and provide information 
establishing that activities involving 
other types of entry either are adversely 
affecting it or likely to do so. For 
background, see Certain Devices for 
Connecting Computers via Telephone 
Lines, Inv. No. 337–TA–360, USITC Pub. No. 2843, Comm’n Op. at 7–10 
(December 1994). 
The statute requires the Commission 
to consider the effects of any remedy 
upon the public interest. The public 
interest factors the Commission will 
consider include the effect that an 
exclusion order and/or cease-and-desist 
order would have on: (1) the public 
health and welfare; (2) competitive 
conditions in the U.S. economy; (3) U.S. 
production of articles that are like or 
directly competitive with those that are 
subject to investigation; and (4) U.S. 
consumers. The Commission is 
therefore interested in receiving written 
submissions that address the 
aforementioned public interest factors 
in the context of this investigation. 
If the Commission orders some form 
of remedy, the U.S. Trade 
Representative, as delegated by the 
President, has 60 days to approve, 
disapprove, or take no action on the 
Commission’s action. See Presidential Memorandum of July 21, 2005. 70 FR 
43251 (July 26, 2005). During this 
period, the subject articles would be 
entitled to enter the United States under 
bond, in an amount determined by the 
Commission and prescribed by the 
Secretary of the Treasury. The 
Commission is therefore interested in 
receiving submissions concerning the 
amount of the bond that should be 
imposed if a remedy is ordered. 
Written Submissions: Parties to this 
investigation, interested government 
agencies, and any other interested 
parties are requested to file written 
submissions on the issues of remedy, 
the public interest, and bonding. In their 
initial submission, Complainants are 
also requested to identify the remedy 
sought and Complainants and OUII are 
requested to submit proposed remedial 
orders for the Commission’s 
consideration. Complainants are further 
requested to state the dates that the 
Asserted Patents expire, to provide the 
HTSUS subheadings under which the 
accused products are imported, and to 
supply the identification information for 
all known importers of the products at 
issue in this investigation. The initial 
written submissions and proposed 
remedial orders must be filed no later 
than close of business on January 9, 
2026. Reply submissions must be filed 
no later than the close of business on 
January 16, 2026. No further 
submissions on any of these issues will 
be permitted unless otherwise ordered 
by the Commission. 
Persons filing written submissions 
must file the original document 
electronically on or before the deadlines 
stated above pursuant to 19 CFR 
210.4(f). Submissions should refer to the 
investigation number (‘‘Inv. No. 337– 
TA–1434’’) in a prominent place on the 
cover page and/or first page. (See 
Handbook for Electronic Filing 
Procedures, https://www.usitc.gov/ documents/handbook_on_filing_procedures.pdf). Persons with questions 
regarding filing should contact the 
Secretary (202–205–2000). 
Any person desiring to submit a 
document to the Commission in 
confidence must request confidential 
treatment by marking each document 
with a header indicating that the 
document contains confidential 
information. This marking will be 
deemed to satisfy the request procedure 
set forth in Rules 201.6(b) and 
210.5(e)(2) (19 CFR 201.6(b) & 
210.5(e)(2)). Documents for which 
confidential treatment by the 
Commission is properly sought will be 
treated accordingly. Any non-party 
wishing to submit comments containing 
confidential information must serve 
those comments on the parties to the 
investigation pursuant to the applicable 
Administrative Protective Order. A 
redacted non-confidential version of the 
document must also be filed with the 
Commission and served on any parties 
to the investigation within two business 
days of any confidential filing. All

countervailing duty investigation Nos. 
701–TA–768–770 and 731–TA–1751– 
1754 (Final) pursuant to the Tariff Act 
of 1930 to determine whether an

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Scope.—For purposes of these 
investigations, Commerce has defined 
the subject merchandise as ‘‘steel 
concrete reinforcing bar imported in 
either straight length or coil form (rebar) 
regardless of metallurgy, length, 
diameter, or grade or lack thereof. The 
subject merchandise includes rebar that 
has been further processed in the 
subject country or a third country, 
including but not limited to cutting, 
grinding, galvanizing, painting, coating, 
or any other processing that would not 
otherwise remove the merchandise from 
the scope of this investigation if 
performed in the country of 
manufacture of the rebar. Specifically 
excluded are plain rounds (i.e., 
nondeformed or smooth rebar).’’ 
Background.—The final phase of 
these investigations is being scheduled 
pursuant to sections 705(b) and 731(b) 
of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1671d(b) and 1673d(b)), as a result of an 
affirmative preliminary determination 
by Commerce that rebar from Algeria is 
being sold in the United States at less 
than fair value within the meaning of 
§ 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). 
Commerce’s preliminary determinations 
with respect to rebar from Bulgaria, 
Egypt, and Vietnam that are alleged to 
be sold in the United States at less than 
fair value and with respect to rebar 
alleged to be subsidized by the 
Governments of Algeria, Egypt, and 
Vietnam are pending. The investigations 
were requested in petitions filed on June 
4, 2025, by Rebar Trade Action 
Coalition, Washington, DC. The 
individual members of the Rebar Trade 
Action Coalition are Byer Steel 
Corporation; Commercial Metals 
Company; Gerdau Ameristeel US 
Incorporated; Nucor Corporation; 
Optimus Steel; and Steel Dynamics,

Commissioner David S. Johanson determines 
that an industry in the United States is threatened 
with material injury by reason of imports of 
hexamine from Germany, India, and Saudi Arabia 
that have been found by Commerce to be sold in 
the United States at LTFV and subsidized by the 
government of India. 
4
The Commission also finds that imports subject 
to Commerce’s affirmative critical circumstances 
determinations with respect to Germany and India 
are not likely to undermine seriously the remedial 
effect of the antidumping duty order on hexamine 
from Germany or the antidumping duty and 
countervailing duty orders on hexamine from India. 
5
Due to the lapse in appropriations and ensuing 
cessation of Commission operations, the 
Commission tolled its schedule for this proceeding. 
The schedule was revised in a subsequent notice 
published in the Federal Register on November 20, 
2025 (90 FR 52436).

On the basis of the record

developed 
in the subject investigations, the United 
States International Trade Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) determines, pursuant 
to the Tariff Act of 1930 (‘‘the Act’’), 
that an industry in the United States is 
materially injured by reason of imports 
of hexamine from Germany, India, and 
Saudi Arabia, provided for in 
subheading 2933.69.50 of the 
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States, that have been found by 
the U.S. Department of Commerce 
(‘‘Commerce’’) to be sold in the United 
States at less than fair value (‘‘LTFV’’) 
and subsidized by the government of 
India.

Background 
The Commission instituted these 
investigations effective September 30, 
2024, following receipt of petitions filed 
with the Commission and Commerce by 
Bakelite Synthetics (Atlanta, Georgia). 
The Commission scheduled the final 
phase of the investigations following 
notification of preliminary 
determinations by Commerce that 
imports of hexamine from China were 
subsidized within the meaning of 
section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
1671b(b)) and sold at LTFV within the 
meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 
U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the 
scheduling of the final phase of the 
Commission’s investigations and of a 
public hearing to be held in connection 
therewith was given by posting copies 
of the notice in the Office of the 
Secretary, U.S. International Trade 
Commission, Washington, DC, and by 
publishing the notice in the Federal 
Register on May 22, 2025 (90 FR 21948 and as revised in 90 FR 31241, July 14, 
2025). The Commission conducted its 
hearing on July 18, 2025. All persons 
who requested the opportunity were 
permitted to participate. 
The investigation schedules became 
staggered when Commerce did not align 
its antidumping and countervailing duty 
investigations with respect to China 
with its antidumping duty 
investigations with respect to Germany, 
India, and Saudi Arabia, and its 
countervailing duty investigation with 
respect to India, and reached earlier 
final antidumping and countervailing 
duty determinations with respect to 
China. On September 3, 2025, the 
Commission issued final affirmative 
determinations in its antidumping and 
countervailing duty investigations of 
hexamine from China (90 FR 43234, 
September 8, 2025). Following 
notification of final determinations by 
Commerce that imports of hexamine 
from Germany, India, and Saudi Arabia 
were being sold at LTFV within the 
meaning of section 735(a) of the Act (19 
U.S.C. 1673d(a)) and that imports of 
hexamine from India were being 
subsidized within the meaning of 
section 703(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
1671b(b)), notice of the supplemental 
scheduling of the final phase of the 
Commission’s antidumping duty 
investigations with respect to Germany, 
India, and Saudi Arabia and its 
countervailing duty investigation with 
respect to India was given by posting 
copies of the notice in the Office of the 
Secretary, U.S. International Trade 
Commission, Washington, DC, and by 
publishing the notice in the Federal 
Register on October 1, 2025 (90 FR 47327).

The Commission made these 
determinations pursuant to §§ 705(b) 
and 735(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 
1671d(b) and 19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)). It 
completed and filed its determinations 
in these investigations on December 22, 
2025. The views of the Commission are 
contained in USITC Publication 5693 
(December 2025), entitled Hexamine

Applications for Amendments to 
Facility Operating Licenses Involving 
Proposed No Significant Hazards 
Consideration Determination and 
Containing Sensitive Unclassified Non- 
Safeguards Information and Order 
Imposing Procedures for Access to 
Sensitive Unclassified Non-Safeguards 
Information 
AGENCY: Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
ACTION: License amendment request; notice of opportunity to comment, 
request a hearing, and petition for leave 
to intervene; order imposing 
procedures. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) received and is 
considering approval of three 
amendment requests. The amendment 
requests are for Braidwood Station, 
Units 1 and 2, and Byron Station, Units 
1 and 2; Catawba Nuclear Station, Units 
1 and 2, and McGuire Nuclear Station, 
Units 1 and 2; and Limerick Generating 
Station, Units 1 and 2. For each 
amendment request, the NRC proposes 
to determine that it involves no 
significant hazards consideration 
(NSHC). Because each amendment 
request contains sensitive unclassified 
non-safeguards information (SUNSI), 
the NRC is issuing an order imposing 
procedures to obtain access to SUNSI 
for contention preparation by persons 
who file a hearing request or petition for 
leave to intervene. 
DATES: Comments must be received by January 29, 2026. A request for a hearing 
or petitions for leave to intervene must 
be filed by March 2, 2026. Any potential 
party as defined in section 2.4 of title 10 
of the Code of Federal Regulations (10 
CFR) who believes access to SUNSI is 
necessary to respond to this notice must 
request document access by January 9, 
2026. 
ADDRESSES: You may submit comments by any of the following methods (unless 
this document describes a different 
method for submitting comments on a

II. Background 
Pursuant to section 189a.(1)–(2) of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended 
(the Act), the NRC is publishing this 
notice. The Act requires the 
Commission to publish notice of any 
amendments issued or proposed to be 
issued and grants the Commission the 
authority to issue and make 
immediately effective any amendment 
to an operating license or combined 
license, as applicable, upon a 
determination by the Commission that 
such amendment involves NSHC, 
notwithstanding the pendency before 
the Commission of a request for a 
hearing from any person. 
This notice includes notices of 
amendments containing SUNSI. 
III. Notice of Consideration of Issuance 
of Amendments to Facility Operating 
Licenses, Proposed No Significant 
Hazards Consideration Determination, 
and Opportunity for a Hearing 
The Commission has made a 
proposed determination that the 
following amendment requests involve 
NSHC. Under the Commission’s 
regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means 
that operation of the facility in 
accordance with the proposed 
amendments would not (1) involve a 
significant increase in the probability or 
consequences of an accident previously 
evaluated, or (2) create the possibility of 
a new or different kind of accident from 
any accident previously evaluated, or 
(3) involve a significant reduction in a 
margin of safety. The basis for this 
proposed determination for each 
amendment request is shown as follows. 
The Commission is seeking public 
comments on these proposed 
determinations. Any comments received 
within 30 days after the date of 
publication of this notice will be 
considered in making any final 
determination. 
Normally, the Commission will not 
issue the amendments until the 
expiration of 60 days after the date of 
publication of this notice. The 
Commission may issue any of these 
license amendments before expiration of 
the 60-day period provided that its final 
determination is that the amendments 
involve no significant hazards 
consideration. In addition, the 
Commission may issue any of these 
amendments prior to the expiration of 
the 30-day comment period if 
circumstances change during the 30-day 
comment period such that failure to act 
in a timely way would result, for 
example, in derating or shutdown of the 
facility. If the Commission takes action 
on any of these amendments prior to the 
expiration of either the comment period 
or the notice period, it will publish a 
notice of issuance in the Federal 
Register. If the Commission makes a 
final no significant hazards 
consideration determination for any of 
these amendments, any hearing on those 
amendments will take place after 
issuance. The Commission expects that 
the need to take this action will occur 
very infrequently. 
A. Opportunity To Request a Hearing 
and Petition for Leave To Intervene 
Within 60 days after the date of 
publication of this notice, any person 
(petitioner) whose interest may be 
affected by any of these actions may file 
a request for a hearing and petition for 
leave to intervene (petition) with respect 
to that action. Petitions shall be filed in 
accordance with the Commission’s 
‘‘Agency Rules of Practice and 
Procedure’’ in 10 CFR part 2. Interested 
persons should consult a current copy 
of 10 CFR 2.309. If a petition is filed, the 
Commission or a presiding officer will 
rule on the petition and, if appropriate, 
a notice of a hearing will be issued. 
Petitions must be filed no later than 
60 days from the date of publication of 
this notice in accordance with the filing 
instructions in the ‘‘Electronic 
Submissions (E-Filing)’’ section of this 
document. Petitions and motions for 
leave to file new or amended 
contentions that are filed after the 
deadline will not be entertained absent 
a determination by the presiding officer 
that the filing demonstrates good cause 
by satisfying the three factors in 10 CFR 
2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iii). 
If a hearing is requested, and the 
Commission has not made a final 
determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission will make a final 
determination on the issue of no 
significant hazards consideration, which 
will serve to establish when the hearing 
is held. If the final determination is that 
the amendment request involves no 
significant hazards consideration, the 
Commission may issue the amendment 
and make it immediately effective, 
notwithstanding the request for a 
hearing. Any hearing would take place 
after issuance of the amendment. If the 
final determination is that the 
amendment request involves a 
significant hazards consideration, then 
any hearing held would take place 
before the issuance of the amendment 
unless the Commission finds an 
imminent danger to the health or safety 
of the public, in which case it will issue 
an appropriate order or rule under 10 
CFR part 2. 
A State, local governmental body, 
Federally recognized Indian Tribe, or 
designated agency thereof, may submit 
a petition to the Commission to 
participate as a party under 10 CFR 
2.309(h) no later than 60 days from the 
date of publication of this notice. 
Alternatively, a State, local 
governmental body, Federally 
recognized Indian Tribe, or agency 
thereof may participate as a non-party 
under 10 CFR 2.315(c). 
For information about filing a petition 
and about participation by a person not 
a party under 10 CFR 2.315, see ADAMS 
Accession No. ML20340A053 (https://
adamswebsearch2.nrc.gov/webSearch2/

public website at https://www.nrc.gov/

B. Electronic Submissions (E-Filing) 
All documents filed in NRC 
adjudicatory proceedings, including 
documents filed by an interested State, 
local governmental body, Federally 
recognized Indian Tribe, or designated 
agency thereof that requests to 
participate under 10 CFR 2.315(c), must 
be filed in accordance with 10 CFR 
2.302. The E-Filing process requires 
participants to submit and serve all 
adjudicatory documents over the 
internet, or in some cases, to mail copies 
on electronic storage media, unless an 
exemption permitting an alternative 
filing method, as further discussed, is 
granted. Detailed guidance on electronic 
submissions is located in the ‘‘Guidance 
for Electronic Submissions to the NRC’’ 
(ADAMS Accession No. ML13031A056), 
and on the NRC’s public website 
(https://www.nrc.gov/site-help/e- 
submittals.html). 
To comply with the procedural 
requirements of E-Filing, at least 10 
days prior to the filing deadline, the 
participant should contact the Office of 
the Secretary by email at 
Hearing.Docket@nrc.gov, or by telephone at 301–415–1677, to: (1) 
request a digital identification (ID) 
certificate which allows the participant 
(or its counsel or representative) to 
digitally sign submissions and access 
the E-Filing system for any proceeding 
in which it is participating; and (2) 
advise the Secretary that the participant 
will be submitting a petition or other 
adjudicatory document (even in 
instances in which the participant, or its

an NRC-issued digital ID certificate). 
Based upon this information, the 
Secretary will establish an electronic 
docket for the proceeding if the 
Secretary has not already established an 
electronic docket. 
Information about applying for a 
digital ID certificate is available on the 
NRC’s public website at https://
www.nrc.gov/site-help/e-submittals/ 
getting-started.html. After a digital ID certificate is obtained and a docket is 
created, the participant must submit 
adjudicatory documents in the Portable 
Document Format. Guidance on 
submissions is available on the NRC’s 
public website at https://www.nrc.gov/ 
site-help/electronic-sub-ref-mat.html. A filing is considered complete at the time 
the document is submitted through the 
NRC’s E-Filing system. To be timely, an 
electronic filing must be submitted to 
the E-Filing system no later than 11:59 
p.m. ET on the due date. Upon receipt 
of a transmission, the E-Filing system 
time-stamps the document and sends 
the submitter an email confirming 
receipt of the document. The E-Filing 
system also distributes an email that 
provides access to the document to the 
NRC’s Office of the General Counsel and 
any others who have advised the Office 
of the Secretary that they wish to 
participate in the proceeding, so that the 
filer need not serve the document on 
those participants separately. Therefore, 
applicants and other participants (or 
their counsel or representative) must 
apply for and receive a digital ID 
certificate before adjudicatory 
documents are filed in order to obtain 
access to the documents via the E-Filing 
system. 
A person filing electronically using 
the NRC’s adjudicatory E-Filing system 
may seek assistance by contacting the 
NRC’s Electronic Filing Help Desk 
through the ‘‘Contact Us’’ link located 
on the NRC’s public website at https:// 
www.nrc.gov/site-help/e- 
submittals.html, by email to MSHD.Resource@nrc.gov, or by a toll- free call at 1–866–672–7640. The NRC 
Electronic Filing Help Desk is available 
between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., ET, Monday 
through Friday, except Federal holidays. 
Participants who believe that they 
have good cause for not submitting 
documents electronically must file an 
exemption request, in accordance with 
10 CFR 2.302(g), with their initial paper 
filing stating why there is good cause for 
not filing electronically and requesting 
authorization to continue to submit 
documents in paper format. Such filings 
must be submitted in accordance with 
10 CFR 2.302(b)–(d). Participants filing 
adjudicatory documents in this manner 
are responsible for serving their 
documents on all other participants. 
Participants granted an exemption 
under 10 CFR 2.302(g)(2) must still meet 
the electronic formatting requirement in 
10 CFR 2.302(g)(1), unless the

A. This Order contains instructions 
regarding how potential parties to this 
proceeding may request access to 
documents containing Sensitive 
Unclassified Non-Safeguards 
Information (SUNSI). 
B. Within 10 days after publication of 
this notice of hearing or opportunity for 
hearing, any potential party who 
believes access to SUNSI is necessary to 
respond to this notice may request 
access to SUNSI. A ‘‘potential party’’ is 
any person who intends to participate as 
a party by demonstrating standing and 
filing an admissible contention under 10 
CFR 2.309. Requests for access to SUNSI 
submitted later than 10 days after 
publication of this notice will not be 
considered absent a showing of good 
cause for the late filing, addressing why 
the request could not have been filed 
earlier. 
C. The requestor shall submit a letter 
requesting permission to access SUNSI 
to the Office of the Secretary, U.S. 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
Washington, DC 20555–0001, Attention: 
Rulemakings and Adjudications Staff, 
and provide a copy to the Deputy 
General Counsel for Licensing, 
Hearings, and Enforcement, Office of the 
General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission, Washington, 
DC 20555–0001. The expedited delivery 
or courier mailing address for both 
offices is: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission, 11555 Rockville Pike, 
Rockville, Maryland 20852. The email 
addresses for the Office of the Secretary 
and the Office of the General Counsel 
are Hearing.Docket@nrc.gov and RidsOgcMailCenter.Resource@nrc.gov, 
respectively.
1
The request must include 
the following information: 
(1) A description of the licensing 
action with a citation to this Federal 
Register notice; (2) The name and address of the 
potential party and a description of the 
potential party’s particularized interest 
that could be harmed by the action 
identified in C.(1); and 
(3) The identity of the individual or 
entity requesting access to SUNSI and 
the requestor’s basis for the need for the 
information in order to meaningfully 
participate in this adjudicatory 
proceeding. In particular, the request 
must explain why publicly available 
versions of the information requested 
would not be sufficient to provide the 
basis and specificity for a proffered 
contention. 
D. Based on an evaluation of the 
information submitted under paragraph 
C, the NRC staff will determine within 
10 days of receipt of the request 
whether: 
(1) There is a reasonable basis to 
believe the petitioner is likely to 
establish standing to participate in this 
NRC proceeding; and 
(2) The requestor has established a 
legitimate need for access to SUNSI. 
E. If the NRC staff determines that the 
requestor satisfies both D.(1) and D.(2), 
the NRC staff will notify the requestor 
in writing that access to SUNSI has been 
granted. The written notification will 
contain instructions on how the 
requestor may obtain copies of the 
requested documents, and any other 
conditions that may apply to access to 
those documents. These conditions may 
include, but are not limited to, the 
signing of a Non-Disclosure Agreement 
or Affidavit, or Protective Order
2
setting 
forth terms and conditions to prevent 
the unauthorized or inadvertent 
disclosure of SUNSI by each individual 
who will be granted access to SUNSI. 
F. Filing of Contentions. Any 
contentions in these proceedings that 
are based upon the information received 
as a result of the request made for 
SUNSI must be filed by the requestor no 
later than 25 days after receipt of (or 
access to) that information. However, if 
more than 25 days remain between the 
petitioner’s receipt of (or access to) the 
information and the deadline for filing 
all other contentions (as established in 
the notice of hearing or opportunity for 
hearing), the petitioner may file its 
SUNSI contentions by that later 
deadline. 
G. Review of Denials of Access. 
(1) If the request for access to SUNSI 
is denied by the NRC staff after a 
determination on standing and requisite

Requestors should note that the filing 
requirements of the NRC’s E-Filing Rule (72 FR 
49139; August 28, 2007, as amended at 77 FR 
46562; August 3, 2012, 78 FR 34247, June 7, 2013) 
apply to appeals of NRC staff determinations 
(because they must be served on a presiding officer or the Commission, as applicable), but not to the 
initial SUNSI request submitted to the NRC staff 
under these procedures. 
need, the NRC staff shall immediately 
notify the requestor in writing, briefly 
stating the reason or reasons for the 
denial. 
(2) The requestor may challenge the 
NRC staff’s adverse determination by 
filing a challenge within 5 days of 
receipt of that determination with: (a) 
the presiding officer designated in this 
proceeding; or (b) if no presiding officer 
has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with 
jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 
2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has 
been designated to rule on information 
access issues, then with that officer. 
(3) Further appeals of decisions under 
this paragraph must be made pursuant 
to 10 CFR 2.311. 
H. Review of Grants of Access. A 
party other than the requestor may 
challenge an NRC staff determination 
granting access to SUNSI whose release 
would harm that party’s interest 
independent of the proceeding. Such a 
challenge must be filed within 5 days of 
the notification by the NRC staff of its 
grant of access and must be filed with: 
(a) the presiding officer designated in 
this proceeding; or (b) if no presiding 
officer has been appointed, the Chief 
Administrative Judge, or if this 
individual is unavailable, another 
administrative judge, or an 
Administrative Law Judge with 
jurisdiction pursuant to 10 CFR 
2.318(a); or (c) if another officer has 
been designated to rule on information 
access issues, then with that officer. 
If challenges to the NRC staff 
determinations are filed, these 
procedures give way to the normal 
process for litigating disputes 
concerning access to information. 
Interlocutory review by the Commission 
on orders ruling on such NRC staff 
determinations (whether granting or 
denying access) is governed by 10 CFR 
2.311.
3
 
I. The Commission expects that the 
NRC staff and presiding officers (and 
any other reviewing officers) will 
consider and resolve requests for access 
to SUNSI, and motions for Protective 
Orders, in a timely fashion in order to 
minimize any unnecessary delays in 
identifying those petitioners who have 
standing and who have propounded 
contentions meeting the specificity and 
basis requirements in 10 CFR part 2. 
The attachment to this Order 
summarizes the general target schedule 
for processing and resolving requests 
under these procedures. 
It is so ordered. 
Dated: December 23, 2025.

To further distinguish current Rule 8.201 from

in Exchange rules, the Exchange proposes to add a 
parenthetical to the title of Rule 8.201 to designate 
it as applicable to non-generically listed series of

proposes non-substantive, conforming changes 
throughout current Rule 8.201 to add references to 
its new title, Rule 8.201 (Non-Generic), to ensure 
specificity and transparency in the rule text. The 
Exchange proposes to retain Rule 8.201 (Non-

Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE

Proposed Rule Change To Adopt New 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
December 22, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
1
of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
2
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
3
 
notice is hereby given that, on December 
10, 2025, the NYSE Texas, Inc. (‘‘NYSE 
Texas’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the self- 
regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes new Rule 
8.201 (Generic) to permit the generic 
listing and trading of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares that meet the requirements 
of such rule. The proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
www.nyse.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission’s 
Public Reference Room. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes new Rule 
8.201 (Generic), which would permit 
the generic listing and trading of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
meet the requirements of the Rule. 
Current Rule 8.201 would continue to 
provide for the listing and trading of 
series of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
for which the Exchange would file 
separate proposals under Section 19(b) 
of the Act.

Consistent with other 
products that may currently list on the 
Exchange pursuant to generic listing 
standards (e.g., Investment Company Units listed pursuant to Rule 5.2(j)(3), 
Managed Fund Shares listed pursuant to 
Rule 8.600, and ETF Shares listed 
pursuant to Rule 5.2(j)(8)), the Exchange 
proposes that Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares that meet the requirements of 
proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) would be 
permitted to be listed and traded on the 
Exchange without prior Commission 
approval order or notice of effectiveness

Rule 19b–4(e)(1) provides that the listing and 
trading of a new derivative securities product by a 
self-regulatory organization (‘‘SRO’’) is not deemed 
a proposed rule change, pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1) of Rule 19b–4, if the Commission has 
approved, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, the 
SRO’s trading rules, procedures and listing 
standards for the product class that would include 
the new derivative securities product and the SRO 
has a surveillance program for the product class. As 
contemplated by proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic), the 
Exchange proposes to establish generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
meet the criteria of the rule. Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares listed under proposed Rule 8.201 
(Generic) would therefore not need a separate 
proposed rule change pursuant to Rule 19b–4 before 
they could be listed and traded on the Exchange. 
Rule 19b–4(e) requires an SRO seeking to rely on 
Rule 19b–4(e) to file Form 19b–4(e) with the 
Commission within 5 business days after 
commencement of trading a new derivative 
securities product that is not deemed to be a 
proposed rule change. 
pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.

The Exchange believes that the 
proposed generic listing standards for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares would 
facilitate the efficient listing of such 
products by significantly reducing the 
time frame and costs associated with 
bringing these securities to market, 
which would in turn promote market 
competition among issuers of such 
products, to the benefit of the investing 
public. 
As further discussed below, proposed 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) is based on Rule 
8.201–E (Generic) of the Exchange’s 
affiliated exchange, NYSE Arca, Inc. 
(‘‘NYSE Arca’’), with only the following 
non-substantive conforming changes: 
€Deletion of references to ‘‘ETP Holder’’ or replacement with references 
to ‘‘Participant’’; and 
€Replacement of internal references to NYSE Arca rules with references to 
NYSE Texas rules (e.g., Rule 7.34 rather than Rule 7.34–E). 
Proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
Proposed Rule 8.201(a) (Generic) 
would provide that the Exchange will 
consider for trading, whether by listing 
or pursuant to unlisted trading 
privileges, Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares that meet the criteria of this Rule 
and that the Exchange may list and/or 
trade Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
that meet the standards set forth in this 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) pursuant to Rule 
19b–4(e) under the Exchange Act. If a 
series of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
listed pursuant to proposed Rule 8.201 
(Generic) does not satisfy these 
requirements, the Exchange may 
suspend trading in the shares and will 
initiate delisting proceedings pursuant 
to Article 22, Rule 4. Proposed Rule 
8.201(a) (Generic) is based on NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201–E(a) (Generic), with 
non-substantive changes to refer to Rule 
8.201 (Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic) and to refer to Article 22, Rule 
4, which is the Exchange’s rule relating 
to delisting proceedings, instead of Rule 
5.5–E(m). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(b) (Generic) 
would provide that Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
is applicable only to Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares listed pursuant to this 
Rule. Except to the extent inconsistent 
with this Rule, or unless the context 
otherwise requires, the provisions of the 
Bylaws and all other rules and 
procedures of the Board of Directors 
shall be applicable to the trading on the 
Exchange of such securities. 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares are 
included within the definition of 
‘‘security’’ or ‘‘securities’’ as such terms 
are used in the Bvlaws and Rules of the 
Exchange and are subject to the 
Exchange’s existing rules governing the 
trading of equity securities. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(b) (Generic) is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(b) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c) (Generic) 
would set forth definitions for purposes 
of Rule 8.201 (Generic). Proposed Rule 
8.201(c)(1) (Generic), which is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(1) (Generic), 
would define Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares for purposes of Rule 8.201 
(Generic) as a security that: 
€Is issued by a trust, limited liability company, partnership, or other similar 
entity (‘‘Trust’’) that, if applicable, is 
operated by a registered commodity 
pool operator pursuant to the 
Commodity Exchange Act, and is not 
registered as an investment company 
pursuant to the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, or series or class thereof 
(proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(i) (Generic)); 
€Is designed to reflect the performance of one or more reference 
assets or an index of reference assets, 
less expenses and other liabilities 
(proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(ii) (Generic)); 
€In order to reflect the performance as provided in (c)(1)(ii) above, is issued 
by a Trust that holds (A) one or more 
commodities or commodity-based assets 
as defined in (c)(3) below, and (B) in 
addition to such commodities or 
commodity-based assets, may hold 
securities, cash, and cash equivalents 
(proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(iii) 
(Generic)); 
€Is issued by a Trust in a specified aggregate minimum number in return 
for a deposit of (A) a specified quantity 
of the underlying commodities, 
commodity-based assets, securities, 
cash, and cash equivalents or (B) a cash 
amount with a value based on the next 
determined net asset value per Trust 
share (proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(iv) 
(Generic)); and 
€When aggregated in the same specified minimum number, may be 
redeemed at a holder’s request by a 
Trust which will deliver to the 
redeeming holder (A) the specified 
quantity of the-underlying commodities, 
commodity-based assets, securities, 
cash, and cash equivalents or (B) a cash 
amount with a value based on the next 
determined net asset value per Trust 
share (proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(v) 
(Generic)). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(2) (Generic) 
would define the term ‘‘commodity’’ to 
have the same meaning as set forth in 
Section 1a(9) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act and to exclude ‘‘excluded 
commodity’’ as defined in Section 
1a(19) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(3) (Generic) 
would define the term ‘‘commodity- 
based asset’’ to mean a future, option, or 
swap on a commodity as defined in 
proposed Rule 8.201(c)(2) above. 
Proposed Rule 8.201–E(c)(3) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201(c)(3) 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(4) (Generic), 
which is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(c)(4) (Generic), would define 
the term ‘‘cash equivalent.’’ The 
Exchange proposes that ‘‘cash 
equivalents’’ would refer to short-term 
instruments with maturities of less than 
three months and include the following, 
as defined in proposed Rules 
8.201(c)(4)(i) (Generic) through (vii) 
(Generic): 
€U.S. Government securities, including bills, notes, and bonds 
differing as to maturity and rate of 
interest, which are either issued or 
guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by 
U.S. Government agencies or 
instrumentalities; 
€Certificates of deposit issued against funds deposited in a bank or 
savings and loan association; 
€Bankers’ acceptances, which are short-term credit instruments used to 
finance commercial transactions; 
€Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements; 
€Bank time deposits, which are monies kept on deposit with banks or 
savings and loan associations for a 
stated period of time at a fixed rate of 
interest; 
€Commercial paper, which are short- term unsecured promissory notes; and 
€Money market funds. Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(5) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘net asset value’’ as an 
amount reflecting the current market 
value of the assets held by the Trust, 
less expenses and liabilities, used to 
periodically compute the current price 
for the purpose of creation and 
redemption of Trust shares. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(c)(5) (Generic) is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(5) (Generic).

I.e., such futures contract has been listed and traded on a designated contract market for at least 
six months. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(6) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘designated contract 
market’’ as a board of trade or exchange 
that has been designated as a contract 
market under Section 5 of the 
Commodity Exchange Act and operates 
under the regulatory oversight of the 
Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, pursuant to Section 5 of 
the Commodity Exchange Act. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(c)(6) (Generic) is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(6) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(7) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘exchange-traded fund’’ 
as an open-end management investment 
company or a unit investment trust as 
defined in Section 4(2) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 or 
series or class thereof, the shares of 
which are listed and traded on a 
national securities exchange, and that 
has formed and operates under an 
exemptive order under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 or in reliance on 
an exemptive rule adopted by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(7) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(7) 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(8) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘indicative trust value’’ as 
the estimated indicative value of a Trust 
share based on current information 
regarding the value of the Trust’s 
underlying assets. Proposed Rule 
8.201(c)(8) (Generic) is based on NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(8) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(9) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘market price’’ as the 
official closing price of a Trust share or, 
if it more accurately reflects the market 
value of a Trust share at the time as of 
which the Trust calculates current net 
asset value per share, the price that is 
the midpoint between the national best 
bid and national best offer as of that 
time. Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(9) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(c)(9) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(10) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘premium or discount’’ as 
the positive or negative difference 
between the market price of a Trust 
share at the time as of which the current 
net asset value is calculated and the 
Trust’s current net asset value per share, 
expressed as a percentage of the Trust 
share’s current net asset value per share. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(10) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201– 
E(c)(10) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(d) (Generic) 
would set forth the eligibility criteria for 
the holdings of Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares listed pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic). Proposed Rule 8.201(d)(1) 
(Generic), which is based on NYSE Arca 
Rule 8.201–E(d)(1) (Generic) with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic), would provide for the 
following criteria, at least one of which 
must be met for each commodity or 
commodity that underlies a commodity- 
based asset held by a Trust: 
€On an initial and continuing basis, the commodity trades on a market that 
is an Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(‘‘ISG’’) member, provided that the 
Exchange may obtain information about 
trading in such commodity from the ISG 
member (proposed Rule 8.201(d)(1)(i) 
(Generic)); 
€On an initial and continuing basis, the commodity underlies a futures 
contract that has been made available to 
trade on a designated contract market 
for at least six months;
6
provided that 
the Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG, with such 
designated contract market (proposed 
Rule 8.201(d)(1)(ii) (Generic)); or 
€On an initial basis, an exchange- traded fund designed to provide 
economic exposure of no less than 40% 
of its net asset value to the commodity 
lists and trades on a national securities 
exchange (proposed Rule 8.201(d)(1)(iii) 
(Generic)). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(d)(2) (Generic) 
would provide that, on an initial and 
continuing basis, each security held by 
the Trust shall meet the criteria of Rule 
8.600 (Managed Fund Shares), 
Commentary .01(a) and (b) or, if the 
security is a listed option, trades on an 
ISG market. Proposed Rule 8.201(d)(2) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(d)(2) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.600 
instead of Rule 8.600–E. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(e) (Generic), 
which is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(e) (Generic), would set forth the 
information that the Trust must disclose 
prominently on its website, which must 
be publicly available free of charge: 
€Before the opening of regular trading on the Exchange, for the Trust’s 
commodities, commodity-based assets, 
securities, cash and cash equivalent, to 
the extent applicable: (i) ticker symbol; 
(ii) identifier; (iii) description of the 
holding; (iv) the quantity of each 
commodity, commodity-based asset, 
security, cash, and cash equivalents

(Generic)); 
€A table showing the number of days the Trust’s shares traded at a premium 
or discount during the most recently 
completed calendar year and the most 
recently completed calendar quarters

(Generic)); 
€A line graph showing the Trust share’s premiums or discounts for the 
most recently completed calendar year 
and the most recently completed 
calendar quarters since that year (or the 
life of the Trust, if shorter) (proposed 
Rule 8.201(e)(4) (Generic)); 
€The Trust share’s median-ask spread, expressed as a percentage 
rounded to the nearest hundredth, 
computed by: (i) identifying the Trust 
share’s national best bid and national 
best offer as of the end of each 10 
second interval during each trading day 
of the last 30 calendar days; (ii) dividing 
the difference between each such bid 
and offer by the midpoint of the 
national best bid and national best offer; 
and (iii) identifying the median of those 
values (proposed Rule 8.201(e)(5) 
(Generic)); 
€Liquidity risk policies and procedures as described in paragraph (g) 
of proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic)

(Generic)); and 
€The Trust’s effective prospectus, in a form available for download (proposed 
Rule 8.201(e)(9) (Generic)). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(f) (Generic) 
would provide that the Trust may not 
seek, directly or indirectly, to provide 
investment returns that correspond to 
the performance of an index, 
benchmark, or reference value by a 
specified multiple, or to provide 
investment returns that have an inverse 
or multiple inverse relationship to the 
performance of an index, benchmark, or 
reference value, over a predetermined 
period of time. Proposed Rule 8.201(f) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(f) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(g) (Generic), 
which is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(g) (Generic), would provide 
that, if a Trust has on a daily basis less 
than 85% of its assets readily available 
to meet redemption requests, the Trust 
must have written liquidity risk policies 
and procedures that are reasonably 
designed to address the risk that it could 
not meet requests to redeem shares

The Exchange notes that proposed Rule 8.201(g) 
(Generic) is intended to, for example, allow a Trust 
issuing Commodity-Based Trust Shares to engage in 
protocol staking, in accordance with guidance 
issued by Commission staff, of the commodity(ies) 
held by the Trust, if applicable. See https://
www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/ 
statement-certain-protocol-staking-activities- 
052925.

For example, for crypto-based series of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares with protocol 
staked assets, the liquidity risk policies and 
procedures would describe the asset(s) staked and 
the percentage of such asset(s) subject to protocol 
staking. 
issued by the Trust without significant 
dilution of remaining shareholders’ 
interest in the Trust.

For purposes of 
this Rule, an asset is deemed not readily 
available to meet redemption requests if 
it is segregated, pledged, hypothecated, 
encumbered, or otherwise restricted or 
prevented from being liquidated, sold, 
transferred, or assigned within one 
business day. Rule 8.201(g) (Generic) 
would further provide that the Trust’s 
liquidity risk policies and procedures 
will be periodically reviewed by the 
Trust (at least annually) and address the 
following criteria, as applicable: 
€The Trust’s investment strategy and liquidity of the Trust’s assets during 
normal and stressed conditions, 
including holdings in derivatives and 
whether the investment strategy is 
appropriate for effective and efficient 
arbitrage (proposed Rule 8.201(g)(1) 
(Generic)); 
€Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing 
arrangements and other funding sources 
(proposed Rule 8.201(g)(2) (Generic)); 
and 
€Percentage and description of the Trust’s assets that are segregated, 
pledged, hypothecated, encumbered, or 
otherwise restricted or prevented from 
being liquidated, sold, transferred or 
assigned (proposed Rule 8.201(g)(3) 
(Generic)).

Proposed Rule 8.201(h) (Generic) 
would provide that Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares may be listed and traded 
on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) provided that, upon initial 
listing, the Exchange will establish a 
minimum number of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares required to be outstanding 
at the time of commencement of trading 
on the Exchange, and all Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares shall have a stated 
investment objective, which shall be 
adhered to under normal market 
conditions. Proposed Rule 8.201(h) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(h) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(i) (Generic) 
would provide for continued listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares listed pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic). Proposed Rule 8.201(i) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(i) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change in proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(9) (Generic) to refer to Rule 
8.201 (Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). The Exchange will maintain 
surveillance procedures for Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares listed under Rule 
8.201 (Generic) and will consider the 
suspension of trading in and the 
delisting of such Trust shares under any 
of the following circumstances: 
€If, following the initial twelve- month period following commencement 
of trading on the Exchange of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, the 
Trust has more than 60 days remaining 
until termination and there are fewer 
than 50 record and/or beneficial holders 
of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(1) (Generic)); or 
€If, following the initial twelve- month period following commencement 
of trading on the Exchange of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, the 
Trust has fewer than 50,000 shares 
issued and outstanding (proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(2) (Generic)); or 
€If, following the initial twelve- month period following commencement 
of trading on the Exchange of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, the 
market value of all shares issued and 
outstanding is less than $1,000,000 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(3) (Generic)); or 
€If the value of the underlying reference asset(s) or index is no longer 
calculated or made widely available on 
at least a 15-second basis from a source 
unaffiliated with the sponsor or the 
Trust (proposed Rule 8.201(i)(4) 
(Generic)); 
€If the Indicative Trust Value is no longer calculated or made widely 
available to all market participants at 
the same time on at least a 15-second 
basis during the Core Trading Session 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(5) (Generic)); 
€If the net asset value is not calculated at least once daily or made 
widely available to all market 
participants at the same time (proposed 
Rule 8.201(i)(6) (Generic)); 
€If the information as set forth in this Rule 8.201 is no longer being disclosed 
in accordance with the requirement of 
paragraph (e) above (proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(7) (Generic)); 
€If any of the other continued listing requirements set forth in this Rule are 
not continuously maintained (proposed 
Rule 8.201(i)(8) (Generic)); 
€If the Exchange submits a rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to 
permit the listing and trading of a series 
of Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
do not otherwise meet the standards set 
forth in this Rule and any of the 
statements or representations regarding 
(a) the description of the index, 
portfolio, or reference asset, (b) 
limitations on the index, portfolio 
holdings, or reference assets, or (c) the 
applicability of Exchange listing rules 
specified in such rule filing are not 
continuously maintained; or if such 
other event shall occur or condition 
exists which in the opinion of the 
Exchange makes further dealings on the 
Exchange inadvisable (proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(9) (Generic)); 
€Upon termination of a Trust, the Exchange requires that Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares issued in connection 
with such Trust be removed from 
Exchange listing. A Trust may terminate 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Trust prospectus, which may provide 
for termination if the value of the Trust 
falls below a specified amount 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(10) (Generic)). 
Rule 8.201(j) (Generic) would set forth 
requirements applicable to Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares issued by an entity 
structured as a trust, on an initial and 
continuing basis. Proposed Rule 
8.201(j)(1) (Generic) would require that 
the stated term of the trust be as stated 
in the trust prospectus, provided that a 
trust may be terminated under such 
earlier circumstances as may be 
specified in the trust prospectus. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(j)(2) (Generic) 
would set forth requirements that apply 
to the trustee of a trust. Proposed Rule 
8.201(j)(2)(i) (Generic) would require 
that the trustee of a trust must be a trust 
company or banking institution having 
substantial capital and surplus and the 
experience and facilities for handling 
corporate trust business and that, if an 
individual has been appointed as 
trustee, a qualified trust company or 
banking institution must be appointed 
co-trustee. Proposed Rule 8.201(j)(2)(ii) 
(Generic) would provide that no change 
is to be made in the trustee of a listed 
issue without prior notice to and 
approval of the Exchange. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(j)(3) (Generic) would provide 
that voting rights will be as set forth in 
the applicable trust prospectus. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(j) (Generic) and the 
subparagraphs thereunder are based on 
current Rule 8.201(e)(3) through (5) 
without any substantive changes, as 
well as on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(j) 
(Generic). 
Rule 8.201(k) (Generic) would provide 
that an issuer of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares must promptly notify the 
Exchange of any non-compliance with 
any of the applicable continued listing 
standards set forth in Rule 8.201 
(Generic). Proposed Rule 8.201(k) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule

substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Rule 8.201(l) (Generic) would set forth 
rules relating to trading halts. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(l)(1) (Generic) would provide 
that the Exchange may halt trading 
during the day in which the 
interruption to the following occurs: (i) 
the value of the underlying reference 
asset(s) or index is not made widely 
available on at least a 15-second basis 
from a source unaffiliated with the 
sponsor or the Trust; (ii) the Indicative 
Trust Value is not made widely 
available to all market participants at 
the same time on at least a 15-second 
basis during the Core Trading Session; 
or (iii) the information required by 
proposed Rule 8.201(e) (Generic) to be 
publicly disclosed on a Trust’s website, 
free of charge, is not being disclosed in 
that manner. If the interruption persists 
past the trading day in which it 
occurred, the Exchange will halt trading 
no later than the beginning of the 
trading day following the interruption. 
If Commodity-Based Trust Shares are 
trading on the Exchange pursuant to 
unlisted trading privileges, the 
Exchange will halt trading as specified 
in Rule 7.34(a). Proposed Rule 
8.201(l)(2) (Generic) would provide that, 
if the Exchange becomes aware that the 
net asset value is not disseminated to all 
the market participants at the same 
time, it will halt trading in the 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares until 
such time as the net asset value is 
available to all market participants. 
Finally, proposed Rule 8.201(l)(3) 
(Generic) would provide that the 
Exchange also may halt trading because 
of market conditions or for reasons that, 
in the view of the Exchange, make 
trading in the Shares inadvisable. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(l) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(l) 
(Generic), with a non-substantive 
change in proposed Rule 8.201(l)(1) to 
refer to Rule 7.34 instead of Rule 7.34– 
E. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(m) (Generic) 
would set forth rules related to Market 
Maker accounts. A Market Maker in 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares listed 
pursuant to Rule 8.201 (Generic) must 
file with the Exchange in a manner 
prescribed by the Exchange and keep 
current a list identifying all accounts for 
trading in each underlying commodity 
and commodity-based asset which the 
Market Maker may have or over which 
it may exercise investment discretion. If 
a Market Maker in Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares that have exposure to, but 
do not, consistent with the definition of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares in this 
Rule 8.201 (Generic), hold one or more 
non-U.S. currencies (‘‘Underlying FX’’), 
such Market Maker also must file with 
the Exchange, in a manner prescribed by 
the Exchange, and keep current a list 
identifying all accounts for trading in 
Underlying FX and derivatives 
overlying Underlying FX which the 
Market Maker may have or over which 
it may exercise investment discretion, as 
well as a list of all commodity and 
commodity-related accounts referenced 
above. No Market Maker in Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares shall trade in a 
commodity, commodity-based asset, 
Underlying FX, or any related derivative 
thereon in an account that the Market 
Maker (1) directly or indirectly controls 
trading activities or has direct interest in 
the profits or losses thereof, (2) is 
required by this rule to disclose to the 
Exchange, and (3) has not reported to 
the Exchange. In addition to the existing 
obligations under Exchange rules 
regarding the production of books and 
records, a Market Maker in Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares shall make available 
to the Exchange such books, records or 
other information pertaining to 
transactions by such entity or registered 
or non-registered employee affiliated 
with such entity for its or their own 
accounts for trading the underlying 
commodity or commodity-based asset, 
applicable Underlying FX, or applicable 
derivatives of each of the foregoing, as 
may be requested by the Exchange. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(m) (Generic) is 
based on current Rule 8.201(g) without 
any substantive changes, as well as on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(m) (Generic) 
with non-substantive changes to refer to 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) instead of Rule 
8.201–E (Generic) and to eliminate 
references to ‘‘ETP Holders’’ as 
inapplicable to trading on NYSE Texas. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(n) (Generic) 
would provide for the establishment of 
firewalls. Specifically, proposed Rule 
8.201(n)(1) (Generic) would provide 
that, if the value of a Commodity-Based 
Trust Share listed pursuant to Rule 
8.201 (Generic) is based in whole or in 
part on an index that is maintained by 
a broker-dealer, the broker-dealer shall 
erect and maintain a ‘‘firewall’’ around 
the personnel responsible for the 
maintenance of such index or who have 
access to information concerning 
changes and adjustments to the index. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(n)(2) (Generic) 
would provide that any advisory 
committee, supervisory board, or similar 
entity that advises an index licensor or 
administrator or that makes decisions 
regarding the index composition 
methodology, and related matters must 
implement and maintain, or be subject 
to, procedures designed to prevent the 
use and dissemination of material, non- 
public information regarding the 
applicable index. Proposed Rule 
8.201(n)(3) (Generic) would provide 
that, if the Trust is affiliated with any 
entity that has the ability to influence 
the price or supply of a commodity, or 
a commodity underlying a commodity- 
based asset, held by the Trust, the Trust 
shall (i) implement and maintain a 
‘‘firewall’’ between any such entity and 
the Trust, (ii) have written policies and 
procedures designed to prevent the use 
and dissemination of material, non- 
public information regarding the Trust; 
and (iii) have written policies and 
procedures designed to prevent 
fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative 
acts, practices, or courses of business 
with respect to the Trust and such 
commodity. Proposed Rule 8.201(n) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(n) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change in proposed Rule 
8.201(n)(1) to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(o) would set 
forth rules relating to the limitation of 
Exchange liability. Neither the Exchange 
nor any agent of the Exchange shall 
have any liability for damages, claims, 
losses or expenses caused by any errors, 
omissions, or delays in calculating or 
disseminating any underlying 
commodity value, the current value of 
the underlying commodity required to 
be deposited to the Trust in connection 
with issuance of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic); resulting from any negligent 
act or omission by the Exchange, or any 
agent of the Exchange, or any act, 
condition or cause beyond the 
reasonable control of the Exchange, its 
agent, including, but not limited to, an 
act of God; fire; flood; extraordinary 
weather conditions; war; insurrection; 
riot; strike; accident; action of 
government; communications or power 
failure; equipment or software 
malfunction; or any error, omission or 
delay in the reports of transactions in an 
underlying commodity. Proposed Rule 
8.201(o) (Generic) is based on current 
Rule 8.201(f), as well as on NYSE Arca 
Rule 8.201–E(o) (Generic) with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Finally, the Exchange proposes 
Commentary to Rule 8.201 (Generic) as 
follows. Proposed Commentary .01 
would provide that the Exchange 
requires that Participants provide all 
purchasers of newly issued Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares a prospectus for the 
series of Commodity-Based Trust

Shares. Proposed Commentary .01 is 
based on current Rule 8.201, 
Commentary .02 without any changes, 
as well as Commentary .01 to NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201–E (Generic) with a non- 
substantive change to refer to 
Participants instead of ETP Holders. 
Proposed Commentary .02 would 
provide that transactions in Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares will occur during 
the trading hours specified in NYSE 
Arca Rule 7.34. Proposed Commentary 
.02 is based on current Rule 8.201, 
Commentary .03 without any changes, 
as well as Commentary .02 to NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201–E (Generic) with a non- 
substantive change to reference Rule 
7.34 instead of Rule 7.34–E. 
Proposed Conforming Changes 
The Exchange proposes conforming 
changes to Rule 5.2(j)(6), which 
provides that Commodity-Linked 
Securities provide for payment at 
maturity based on the performance of 
one or more physical commodities or 
commodity futures, options or other 
commodity derivatives or Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares (as defined in Rule 
8.201) or a basket or index of any of the 
foregoing. The Exchange proposes a 
conforming change to Rule 5.2(j)(6) to 
specify that the reference to 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares is as 
defined in Rule 8.201 (Non-Generic) or 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) to ensure that this 
rule accommodates Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares listed pursuant to either 
rule. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The proposed rule change is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,
9
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5),
10
in particular, because 
it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
The Exchange believes proposed Rule 
8.201 (Generic) would promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, remove 
impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and 
protect investors and the public interest 
by establishing generic standards for 
listing and trading of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares. Proposed Rule 8.201 
(Generic) would allow Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares that meet the 
requirements of the Rule to be listed and 
traded on the Exchange without prior 
Commission approval order or notice of 
effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b) 
of the Act. Accordingly, the proposed 
rule change would promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, remove 
impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and 
protect investors and the public interest 
because it would facilitate efficient 
procedures for listing Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares that meet the requirements 
of proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic), 
thereby reducing the time, resources, 
and costs associated with bringing new 
series of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
to market and promoting competition 
among issuers of such products, to the 
benefit of the market participants. In 
addition, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would further the 
intended objective of Rule 19b–4(e) 
under the Act by permitting 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
satisfy the proposed listing standards in 
proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) to be 
listed and traded without separate 
Commission approval. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed changes would promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, 
remove impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and 
protect investors and the public interest 
because the proposed rules are based on 
the rules of the Exchange’s affiliated 
market, NYSE Arca, which rules have 
been approved by the Commission. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule changes 
would facilitate the Exchange’s ability 
to list and trade Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares under generic listing standards 
identical to NYSE Arca’s. The Exchange 
also believes that the proposed rule 
change would remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system by promoting consistency across 
the rules of affiliated exchanges. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Instead, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change would facilitate the listing 
and trading of Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares through an efficient process that 
would enhance competition among 
market participants, to the benefit of 
investors and the marketplace. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
generic listing standards in Rule 8.201 
(Generic) would reduce the timeframe 
for bringing additional series of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares to 
market, thereby reducing the burdens on 
issuers and other market participants 
and promoting competition among 
issuers of such products. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited 
or received with respect to the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Within 45 days of the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period 
to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which 
the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission will: 
(A) by order approve or disapprove 
the proposed rule change, or 
(B) institute proceedings to determine 
whether the proposed rule change 
should be disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change, is consistent with the Act.

‘‘Specialized Quote Feed’’ or ‘‘SQF’’ is an 
interface that allows Market Makers to connect, 
send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses 
into and from the Exchange. Features include the 
following: (1) options symbol directory messages 
(e.g., underlying instruments); (2) system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) 
quote messages; (6) Immediate-or-Cancel Order 
messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge 
notifications; (8) opening imbalance messages; (9) 
auction notifications; and (10) auction responses. 
The SQF Purge Interface only receives and notifies 
of purge requests from the Market Maker. Market 
Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their 
assigned options series. Immediate-or-Cancel 
Orders entered into SQF are not subject to the Order

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Nasdaq 
GEMX, LLC; Notice of Filing and 
Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port Fees 
December 22, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
16, 2025, Nasdaq GEMX, LLC (‘‘GEMX’’ 
or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Specialized Quote Feed
3
or ‘‘SQF’’ Port 
and SQF Purge Port pricing at Options 
7, Section 6, Ports and Other Services.
4
 
While the changes proposed herein 
are effective upon filing, the Exchange 
has designated the amendments become 
operative on January 1, 2026. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/gemx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
GEMX proposes to amend its SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port pricing at 
Options 7, Section 6, Ports and Other 
Services by offering an incentive to 
Market Makers
5
to lower their SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Pursuant to a prior rule change,
6
as of 
January 1, 2026, GEMX will assess an 
SQF Port Fee and SQF Purge Port Fee 
as follows: The first 5 ports (1–5) would 
be assessed $1,620 per port, per month; 
the next 15 ports (6–20) would be 
assessed $1,080 per port, per month; 
and all ports over 20 ports (21 and 
above) would be assessed $540 per port, 
per month. SR–GEMX–2025–22 
amended its SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Fees to be identical to NOM’s SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Today, NOM aggregates its SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port Fees for purposes 
of the tier qualification. At this time, to 
make clear the manner in which GEMX 
will determine qualifications for the 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port tiers, the 
Exchange proposes to note that, ‘‘The 
SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge Port 
Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows.’’
7
 
Additionally, the Exchange would 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables. The 
Exchange intends to calculate SQF Ports 
and SQF Purge Ports on January 1, 2026, 
the effective date of SR–GEMX–2025– 
22, identical to NOM.
8
 
Additionally, at this time, the 
Exchange proposes to offer an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to offer certain 
discounts to Market Makers that have 
transacted a certain percentage of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
For purposes of this proposal, the 
percentage of Total National Volume is

Cboe currently offers its market makers credits 
on their monthly BOE Bulk Port Fees. Specifically, 
if a Cboe market maker affiliate (‘‘affiliate’’ defined 
as having at least 75% common ownership between 
the two entities as reflected on each entity’s Form 
BD, Schedule A) or Cboe Appointed OFP receives 
a credit under the Exchange’s Volume Incentive 
Program (‘‘VIP’’), the Cboe market maker will 
receive an access credit on their BOE Bulk Ports 
corresponding to the VIP tier reached. The credit is 
based on the Performance Tier earned by a market 
maker under Cboe’s Liquidity Provider Sliding 
Scale Adjustment Table. Tiers 4 and 5 earn a 40% 
credit on monthly Cboe Bulk Port Fees. Cboe 
assesses BOE Bulk Logical Ports a fee of $1,500 for 
1 to 5 ports, a fee of $2,500 for 6 to 30 ports and 
a fee of $3,000 for over 30 ports. Additionally, each 
BOE Bulk Logical Port will incur the logical port 
fee indicated when used to enter up to 30,000,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured 
on average in a single month. Each incremental

that transacted less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
would not receive a discount on SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. A Market 
Maker that transacted greater than or 
equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% of 
Total National Volume in the prior 
month will be afforded a discount of 
10% on their SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Fees. A Market Maker that 
transacted greater than or equal to 
0.25% and less than 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 30% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Finally, a Market Maker that transacted 
greater than or equal to 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 50% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
By way of example, a Market Maker that 
executed 3,000,000 in Penny Volume 
and 200,000 in Non-Penny Volume in a 
given month on the Exchange, where 
the Total National Volume was 
1,000,000,000, would qualify for a 
discount of 50% on their SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port fees ((200,000 × 5 = 1,000,000) + 3,000,000 = 4,000,000 
which is 0.40% of 1,000,000,000). 
The Exchange proposes to calculate 
Market Maker Non-Penny Symbol 
volume at five times the weight as 
compared to Market Maker Penny 
Symbol volume because Non-Penny 
Symbols tend to have lower volumes 
and this incentive should encourage a 
greater amount of volume in Non-Penny 
Symbols. Overall, the proposed 
discounts should encourage Market 
Makers to transact additional order flow 
on GEMX with which other market 
participants may interact, for an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. The Exchange proposes 
to exclude index options as index 
options are generally not multiply 
listed. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
9
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
10
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
11
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
12
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
13
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
14
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’ ....’’15
Although the court 
and the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are 
reasonable because they will attract a 
greater amount of order flow to GEMX 
with which other market participants 
may interact while also lowering costs 
for certain Market Makers that are able 
to transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
The Exchange believes it is reasonable 
to lower costs for certain Market Makers 
that transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume on GEMX because 
those Market Makers are affording other 
GEMX Members an opportunity to 
interact with that order flow. The 
proposal provides an incremental 
incentive for Market Makers that 
transact at least 0.10% of Total National 
Volume, which provides a higher 
benefit for satisfying increasingly more 
stringent criteria. The Exchange believes 
that the value of the proposed discounts 
is commensurate with the difficulty to 
achieve the corresponding threshold. 
Additionally, the discounts may 
incentivize and attract more volume and 
liquidity to the Exchange, which will 
benefit all Exchange participants 
through increased opportunities to trade 
as well as enhancing price discovery. 
The Exchange’s proposed discounts are 
substantially similar to Cboe Exchange, 
Inc.’s (‘‘Cboe’’) credit for their BOE Bulk 
Port Fees.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61183 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices Bulk Logical Port will incur an additional logical 
port fee of $3,000 per month. Incremental usage 
will be determined on a monthly basis based on the 
average orders per day entered in a single month 
across all subscribed BOE Bulk Logical Ports. 
17
Penny Symbols typically are more liquid 
symbols. 
18
For example, a Market Maker may desire to 
utilize multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, 
to measure performance, for regulatory reasons or 
other determinations that are specific to that 
Member. 
19
GEMX Market Makers have various regulatory 
requirements as provided for in Options 2, Section 
4. Additionally, GEMX Market Makers have certain 
quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. 
SQF Ports are the only quoting protocol available 
on GEMX and only Market Makers may utilize SQF 
Ports. 
20
See GEMX Options 2, Section 5. 21
See GEMX Options 2, Section 4. 22
See GEMX Options 2, Section 4(b). 23
See Options 2, Section 5. 24
See Options 2, Section 4. 25
See Options 2, Section 4(a)(3) and (6). GEMX believes it is reasonable to 
offer fee discounts to those Market 
Makers that primarily provide and post 
liquidity to the Exchange, as it should 
encourage Market Makers to continue to 
participate on the Exchange and add 
liquidity. Greater liquidity benefits all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities and tighter 
spreads. The proposal would also 
mitigate the costs incurred by Market 
Makers on GEMX. 
Calculating Market Maker Non-Penny 
Symbol volume at five times the weight 
as compared to Penny Symbol volume 
is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as Non-Penny Symbols 
tend to have lower volumes and this 
incentive should encourage a greater 
amount of volume in Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbols.
17
The Exchange 
proposes to calculate the Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume in an 
uniform manner for all Members. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally 
not multiply listed. Index Options 
would be uniformly excluded. 
A GEMX Market Maker requires only 
one SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into GEMX. A 
Market Maker may submit all quotes 
through one SQF Port. This is also the 
case for an SQF Purge Port. While a 
Market Maker may elect to obtain 
multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports 
to organize its business,
18
only one SQF 
Port is necessary for an GEMX Market 
Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.
19
 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory as they 
would apply uniformly to each GEMX 
Market Maker. The Exchange would 
uniformly calculate the Market Maker’s 
percentage each month. Although only 
Market Makers may receive the 
proposed discounts, the Exchange notes 
that Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
20
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
21
While the Exchange is not 
offering a discount to those Market 
Makers that transact less than 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, the Exchange 
notes that these Market Makers transact 
a much lower amount of contracts on 
GEMX as compared to other Market 
Makers who qualify for a discount. In 
some cases, these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers to improve the market in all 
series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed and to 
update market quotations in response to 
changed market conditions in all series 
of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed.
22
The Exchange 
believes that all Market Makers are 
capable of quoting tighter or in a greater 
amount of options classes to obtain the 
requisite volume to achieve a discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to note that, 
‘‘The SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows’’ and to 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as it will reflect that 
GEMX intends to calculate the SQF Port 
Fee and the SQF Purge Port Fees by 
aggregating them for purposes of the tier 
calculation. This reflects the intent of 
SR–GEMX–2025–22, which stated that 
the GEMX SQF Port Fee and the SQF 
Purge Port Fee would be identical to the 
NOM SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
the proposed discounts for SQF Ports 
and SQF Purge Ports do not impose a 
burden on competition because they 
would apply uniformly to each Market 
Maker and the Exchange would 
uniformly calculate the Market Maker’s 
percentage each month. Although only 
Market Makers may receive the 
proposed discounts, the Exchange notes 
that Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
23
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
24
Further, while the Exchange 
is not offering a discount to those 
Market Makers that transact less than 
0.10% of Total National Volume, the 
Exchange notes that these Market 
Makers transact a much lower amount 
of contracts on GEMX as compared to 
other Market Makers that qualify for the 
discount and/or these Market Makers 
are not executing the requisite amount 
of Penny Symbols or Non-Penny 
Symbols to obtain the discount. The 
Exchange’s proposal does not impose an 
undue burden on competition because 
Market Makers are required to compete 
with other Market Makers and maintain 
active markets in all options in which 
the Market Maker is registered.
25
The 
Exchange believes that all Market 
Makers are capable of quoting tighter or 
in a greater amount of options classes to 
obtain the requisite volume to achieve a 
discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to note that, 
‘‘The SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows’’ and to 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition as it will reflect that GEMX 
intends to calculate the SQF Port Fee 
and the SQF Purge Port Fees by 
aggregating them for purposes of the tier 
calculation. This reflects the intent of 
SR–GEMX–2025–22, which stated that 
the GEMX SQF Port Fee and the SQF 
Purge Port Fee would be identical to the 
NOM SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. In addition to the 
Exchange, market participants have 
alternative options exchanges that they 
may participate on and direct their

order flow. In sum, if the changes 
proposed herein are unattractive to 
market participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing options exchanges to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

‘‘Specialized Quote Feed’’ or ‘‘SQF’’ is an 
interface that allows Market Makers to connect, 
send, and receive messages related to quotes, 
Immediate-or-Cancel Orders, and auction responses 
into and from the Exchange. Features include the 
following: (1) options symbol directory messages 
(e.g., underlying instruments); (2) system event messages (e.g., start of trading hours messages and start of opening); (3) trading action messages (e.g., halts and resumes); (4) execution messages; (5) 
quote messages; (6) Immediate-or-Cancel Order 
messages; (7) risk protection triggers and purge 
notifications; (8) opening imbalance messages; (9) 
auction notifications; and (10) auction responses. 
The SQF Purge Interface only receives and notifies 
of purge requests from the Market Maker. Market 
Makers may only enter interest into SQF in their

‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend its 
Specialized Quote Feed
3
or ‘‘SQF’’ Port 
and SQF Purge Port pricing at Options 
7, Section 6, Ports and Other Services.
4
 
While the changes proposed herein 
are effective upon filing, the Exchange 
has designated the amendments become 
operative on January 1, 2026. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/mrx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
MRX proposes to amend its SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port pricing at Options 
7, Section 6, Ports and Other Services by 
offering an incentive to Market Makers
5
 
to lower their SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Fees. 
Pursuant to a prior rule change,
6
as of 
January 1, 2026, MRX will assess an 
SQF Port Fee and SQF Purge Port Fee 
as follows: The first 5 ports (1–5) would 
be assessed $1,620 per port, per month; 
the next 15 ports (6–20) would be 
assessed $1,080 per port, per month; 
and all ports over 20 ports (21 and 
above) would be assessed $540 per port, 
per month. SR–MRX–2025–20 amended 
its SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees 
to be identical to NOM’s SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Today, NOM aggregates its SQF Port 
and SQF Purge Port Fees for purposes 
of the tier qualification. At this time, to 
make clear the manner in which MRX 
will determine qualifications for the 
SQF Port and SQF Purge Port tiers, the 
Exchange proposes to note that, ‘‘The 
SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge Port 
Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows.’’
7
 
Additionally, the Exchange would 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables. The 
Exchange intends to calculate SQF Ports 
and SQF Purge Ports on January 1, 2026, 
the effective date of SR–MRX–2025–20, 
identical to NOM.
8
 
Additionally, at this time, the 
Exchange proposes to offer an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to offer certain 
discounts to Market Makers that have 
transacted a certain percentage of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
For purposes of this proposal, the 
percentage of Total National Volume is 
calculated by taking the total Market 
Maker Penny Symbol and Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume (excluding 
index options) executed on the 
Exchange in the prior month and 
attributing a multiple of five times to 
that Non-Penny Symbol volume 
(numerator) and dividing that by Market 
Maker volume (‘‘M’’ capacity at The 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’)) 
in multiply listed options across all 
options exchanges (denominator or 
Total National Volume). 
Tier Percentage of Total National Volume Percentage 
SQF Port and 
SQF Purge 
Port discount 
1 ............................... less than 0.10% ............................................................................................................................................. 0 2 ............................... greater than or equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% ................................................................................... 10 3 ............................... greater than or equal to 0.25% and less than 0.40% ................................................................................... 30 4 ............................... greater than or equal to 0.40% ..................................................................................................................... 50 With this proposal, a Market Maker 
that transacted less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
would not receive a discount on SQF 
Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. A Market 
Maker that transacted greater than or

Cboe currently offers its market makers credits 
on their monthly BOE Bulk Port Fees. Specifically, 
if a Cboe market maker affiliate (‘‘affiliate’’ defined 
as having at least 75% common ownership between 
the two entities as reflected on each entity’s Form 
BD, Schedule A) or Cboe Appointed OFP receives 
a credit under the Exchange’s Volume Incentive 
Program (‘‘VIP’’), the Cboe market maker will 
receive an access credit on their BOE Bulk Ports 
corresponding to the VIP tier reached. The credit is 
based on the Performance Tier earned by a market 
maker under Cboe’s Liquidity Provider Sliding 
Scale Adjustment Table. Tiers 4 and 5 earn a 40% 
credit on monthly Cboe Bulk Port Fees. Cboe 
assesses BOE Bulk Logical Ports a fee of $1,500 for 
1 to 5 ports, a fee of $2,500 for 6 to 30 ports and 
a fee of $3,000 for over 30 ports. Additionally, each 
BOE Bulk Logical Port will incur the logical port 
fee indicated when used to enter up to 30,000,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured 
on average in a single month. Each incremental 
usage of up to 30,000,000 orders per day per BOE 
Bulk Logical Port will incur an additional logical 
port fee of $3,000 per month. Incremental usage 
will be determined on a monthly basis based on the 
average orders per day entered in a single month 
across all subscribed BOE Bulk Logical Ports.

Penny Symbols typically are more liquid 
symbols. 
equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% of 
Total National Volume in the prior 
month will be afforded a discount of 
10% on their SQF Port and SQF Purge 
Port Fees. A Market Maker that 
transacted greater than or equal to 
0.25% and less than 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 30% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
Finally, a Market Maker that transacted 
greater than or equal to 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 50% on 
their SQF Port and SQF Purge Port Fees. 
By way of example, a Market Maker that 
executed 3,000,000 in Penny Volume 
and 200,000 in Non-Penny Volume in a 
given month on the Exchange, where 
the Total National Volume was 
1,000,000,000, would qualify for a 
discount of 50% on their SQF Port and 
SQF Purge Port fees ((200,000 × 5 = 1,000,000) + 3,000,000 = 4,000,000 
which is 0.40% of 1,000,000,000). 
The Exchange proposes to calculate 
Market Maker Non-Penny Symbol 
volume at five times the weight as 
compared to Market Maker Penny 
Symbol volume because Non-Penny 
Symbols tend to have lower volumes 
and this incentive should encourage a 
greater amount of volume in Non-Penny 
Symbols. Overall, the proposed 
discounts should encourage Market 
Makers to transact additional order flow 
on MRX with which other market 
participants may interact, for an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port and SQF 
Purge Port Fees. The Exchange proposes 
to exclude index options as index 
options are generally not multiply 
listed. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
9
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
10
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
11
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
12
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
13
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
14
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’....’’
15
Although the court 
and the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are 
reasonable because they will attract a 
greater amount of order flow to MRX 
with which other market participants 
may interact while also lowering costs 
for certain Market Makers that are able 
to transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month. 
The Exchange believes it is reasonable 
to lower costs for certain Market Makers 
that transact greater than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume on MRX because those 
Market Makers are affording other MRX 
Members an opportunity to interact 
with that order flow. The proposal 
provides an incremental incentive for 
Market Makers that transact at least 
0.10% of Total National Volume, which 
provides a higher benefit for satisfying 
increasingly more stringent criteria. The 
Exchange believes that the value of the 
proposed discounts is commensurate 
with the difficulty to achieve the 
corresponding threshold. Additionally, 
the discounts may incentivize and 
attract more volume and liquidity to the 
Exchange, which will benefit all 
Exchange participants through 
increased opportunities to trade as well 
as enhancing price discovery. The 
Exchange’s proposed discounts are 
substantially similar to Cboe Exchange, 
Inc.’s (‘‘Cboe’’) credit for their BOE Bulk 
Port Fees.
16
 
MRX believes it is reasonable to offer 
fee discounts to those Market Makers 
that primarily provide and post 
liquidity to the Exchange, as it should 
encourage Market Makers to continue to 
participate on the Exchange and add 
liquidity. Greater liquidity benefits all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities and tighter 
spreads. The proposal would also 
mitigate the costs incurred by Market 
Makers on MRX. 
Calculating Market Maker Non-Penny 
Symbol volume at five times the weight 
as compared to Penny Symbol volume 
is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as Non-Penny Symbols 
tend to have lower volumes and this 
incentive should encourage a greater 
amount of volume in Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbols.
17
The Exchange 
proposes to calculate the Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume in an 
uniform manner for all Members. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally

For example, a Market Maker may desire to 
utilize multiple SQF Ports for accounting purposes, 
to measure performance, for regulatory reasons or 
other determinations that are specific to that 
Member. 
19
MRX Market Makers have various regulatory 
requirements as provided for in Options 2, Section 
4. Additionally, MRX Market Makers have certain 
quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. 
SQF Ports are the only quoting protocol available 
on MRX and only Market Makers may utilize SQF 
Ports. 
20
See MRX Options 2, Section 5. 21
See MRX Options 2, Section 4. 22
See MRX Options 2, Section 4(b). 23

See Options 2, Section 4(a)(3) and (6). 26
15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A)(ii). 
not multiply listed. Index Options 
would be uniformly excluded. 
An MRX Market Maker requires only 
one SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into MRX. A 
Market Maker may submit all quotes 
through one SQF Port. This is also the 
case for an SQF Purge Port. While a 
Market Maker may elect to obtain 
multiple SQF Ports and SQF Purge Ports 
to organize its business,
18
only one SQF 
Port is necessary for an MRX Market 
Maker to fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.
19
 
The proposed fee discounts for SQF 
Ports and SQF Purge Ports are equitable 
and not unfairly discriminatory as they 
would apply uniformly to each MRX 
Market Maker. The Exchange would 
uniformly calculate the Market Maker’s 
percentage each month. Although only 
Market Makers may receive the 
proposed discounts, the Exchange notes 
that Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
20
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
21
While the Exchange is not 
offering a discount to those Market 
Makers that transact less than 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, the Exchange 
notes that these Market Makers transact 
a much lower amount of contracts on 
MRX as compared to other Market 
Makers who qualify for a discount. In 
some cases, these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers to improve the market in all 
series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed and to 
update market quotations in response to 
changed market conditions in all series 
of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed.
22
The Exchange 
believes that all Market Makers are 
capable of quoting tighter or in a greater 
amount of options classes to obtain the 
requisite volume to achieve a discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to note that, 
‘‘The SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows’’ and to 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables is 
reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as it will reflect that 
MRX intends to calculate the SQF Port 
Fee and the SQF Purge Port Fees by 
aggregating them for purposes of the tier 
calculation. This reflects the intent of 
SR–MRX–2025–20, which stated that 
the MRX SQF Port Fee and the SQF 
Purge Port Fee would be identical to the 
NOM SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
the proposed discounts for SQF Ports 
and SQF Purge Ports do not impose a 
burden on competition because they 
would apply uniformly to each Market 
Maker and the Exchange would 
uniformly calculate the Market Maker’s 
percentage each month. Although only 
Market Makers may receive the 
proposed discounts, the Exchange notes 
that Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
23
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
24
Further, while the Exchange 
is not offering a discount to those 
Market Makers that transact less than 
0.10% of Total National Volume, the 
Exchange notes that these Market 
Makers transact a much lower amount 
of contracts on MRX as compared to 
other Market Makers that qualify for the 
discount and/or these Market Makers 
are not executing the requisite amount 
of Penny Symbols or Non-Penny 
Symbols to obtain the discount. The 
Exchange’s proposal does not impose an 
undue burden on competition because 
Market Makers are required to compete 
with other Market Makers and maintain 
active markets in all options in which 
the Market Maker is registered.
25
The 
Exchange believes that all Market 
Makers are capable of quoting tighter or 
in a greater amount of options classes to 
obtain the requisite volume to achieve a 
discount. 
The Exchange’s proposal to note that, 
‘‘The SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee are aggregated for the below 
incremental tiers as follows’’ and to 
relocate the tier qualifications to one 
table instead of two separate tables does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition as it will reflect that MRX 
intends to calculate the SQF Port Fee 
and the SQF Purge Port Fees by 
aggregating them for purposes of the tier 
calculation. This reflects the intent of 
SR–MRX–2025–20, which stated that 
the MRX SQF Port Fee and the SQF 
Purge Port Fee would be identical to the 
NOM SQF Port Fee and the SQF Purge 
Port Fee. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
options exchanges. In addition to the 
Exchange, market participants have 
alternative options exchanges that they 
may participate on and direct their 
order flow. In sum, if the changes 
proposed herein are unattractive to 
market participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing options exchanges to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

Rule to be consistent with the 
amendment to the CAT NMS Plan 
related to the BFMM Locate Exception. 
In 2023, the Commission amended the 
CAT NMS Plan to require the reporting 
to the CAT of reliance on the BFMM 
Locate Exception.
5
Specifically, the 
Commission added paragraph (D) to 
Section 6.4(d)(ii) of the CAT NMS Plan, 
which requires each Participant, 
through its Compliance Rule, to require 
its Industry Members to record and 
report to the Central Repository the 
following: 
for the original receipt or origination of an 
order to sell an equity security, whether the 
order is for a short sale effected by a market 
maker in connection with bona fide market 
making activities in the security for which 
the exception in Rule 203(b)(2)(iii) of 
Regulation SHO is claimed. 
Accordingly, the Exchange proposes 
to amend its CAT Compliance Rule to 
reflect this additional CAT reporting 
requirement. Specifically, the Exchange 
proposes to add paragraph (G) to Rule 
11.630, which would require each 
Industry Member to record and report to 
the Central Repository the following: 
for the original receipt or origination of an 
order to sell an equity security, whether the 
order is for a short sale effected by a market 
maker in connection with bona fide market 
making activities in the security for which 
the exception in Rule 203(b)(2)(iii) of 
Regulation SHO is claimed. 
(b) Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the provisions of Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act,
6
which require, among other

the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement.

things, that the Exchange’s rules must 
be designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest, and 
Section 6(b)(8) of the Act,
7
which 
requires that the Exchange’s rules not 
impose any burden on competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate. 
The Exchange believes that this 
proposal is consistent with the Act 
because it is consistent with the 
amendment to the CAT NMS Plan 
approved by the Commission and is 
designed to assist the Exchange and its 
Industry Members in meeting regulatory 
obligations pursuant to the Plan. In 
approving the Plan, the SEC noted that 
the Plan ‘‘is necessary and appropriate 
in the public interest, for the protection 
of investors and the maintenance of fair 
and orderly markets, to remove 
impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of a national market system, 
or is otherwise in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act.’’
8
To the extent 
that this proposal implements the Plan 
as amended, and applies specific 
requirements to Industry Members, the 
Exchange believes that this proposal 
furthers the objectives of the Plan, as 
identified by the SEC, and is therefore 
consistent with the Exchange Act. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will result in 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 
The Exchange notes that the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
amendment to the CAT NMS Plan 
approved by the Commission and is 
designed to assist the Exchange in 
meeting its regulatory obligations 
pursuant to the Plan. The Exchange also 
notes that the amendment to the CAT 
Compliance Rule will apply equally to 
all Industry Members that trade equity 
securities. In addition, all national 
securities exchanges and FINRA are 
proposing these amendments to their 
CAT Compliance Rules. Therefore, this 
is not a competitive rule filing, and, 
therefore, it does not impose a burden 
on competition. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
9
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
10
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
11
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
12
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative 
immediately upon filing. The 
Commission believes that waiving 30- 
day operative delay is consistent with 
the protection of investors and the 
public interest because the proposal 
seeks to amend the Exchange’s CAT 
Compliance Rule to reflect the 
requirement in the CAT NMS Plan that 
industry members report for the original 
receipt or origination of an order to sell 
an equity security, whether the order is 
for a short sale effected by a market 
maker in connection with bona fide 
market making activities in the security 
for which the exception in Rule 
203(b)(2)(iii) of Regulation SHO is 
claimed.
13
The proposal does not 
introduce any novel regulatory issues. 
Accordingly, the Commission 
designates the proposed rule change to 
be operative upon filing.
14
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments

arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; The

Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of 
a Proposed Rule Change To Amend 
the Exchange’s Rules Related to 
Round Lot and Normal Unit of Trading 
December 22, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
11, 2025, The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC 
(the ‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Nasdaq’’) filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I and II below, which Items have 
been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Exchange filed the proposal as a ‘‘non- 
controversial’’ proposed rule change 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of 
the Act
3
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6) 
thereunder.
4
The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
Exchange’s rules related to round lot 
and normal unit of trading, specifically, 
Nasdaq Rules 5005(a)(40) and 
5720(c)(6), Nasdaq Equity Rule 2, 
Section 5(a)(1) and Nasdaq Equity Rule 
4, Section 4703(b)(1), to bring the rules 
into compliance with Regulation 
National Market System Rule 
600(b)(93).
5
 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/nasdaq/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The purpose of the proposed rule 
change is to amend the amend the 
Exchange’s rules related to round lot 
and normal unit of trading, specifically, 
Nasdaq Rules 5005(a)(40) and 
5720(c)(6), Nasdaq Equity Rule 2, 
Section 5(a)(1) and Nasdaq Equity Rule 
4, Section 4703(b)(1), to bring the rules 
into compliance with Regulation 
National Market System (‘‘Reg NMS’’) 
Rule 600(b)(93).
6
 
On December 9, 2020, the 
Commission adopted amendments to 
Reg NMS, specifically, the Market Data 
Infrastructure rules to modernize the 
NMS information provided within the 
national market system for the benefit of 
market participants and to better 
achieve Section 11A’s goals of assuring 
‘‘the availability to brokers, dealers, and 
investors of information with respect to 
quotations for and transactions in 
securities that is prompt, accurate, 
reliable, and fair’’ (‘‘MDI Rules’’). These 
changes included a definition of ‘‘round 
lot’’ which assigns each NMS stock to a 
round lot size based on the stock’s 
average closing price.
7
Prior to this 
change, a ‘‘round lot’’ was not defined 
in the Act or Reg NMS. The definition 
of a ‘‘round lot’’ was included in the 
rules of each exchange, including 
Nasdaq Rules 5005(a)(40) and 
5720(c)(6), Nasdaq Equity Rule 2, 
Section 5(a)(1) and Nasdaq Equity Rule 
4, Section 4703(b)(1), which typically 
defined a ‘‘round lot’’ as 100 shares, but 
they also allow an exchange, or the 
primary listing exchange for the 
security, discretion to define it 
otherwise. 
In light of delays in the 
implementation of the MDI Rules, 
including the definition of round lot, on 
September 18, 2024, the Commission, 
among other things, accelerated the 
implementation of the round lot 
definition. The Commission also revised 
the round lot definition as set forth 
below.
8
Rule 600(b)(93) of Reg NMS, as 
adopted by the MDI Rules and as 
amended in 2024, defines a round lot 
for NMS stocks
9
that have an average 
closing price on the primary listing 
exchange during the prior Evaluation 
Period
10
of: (1) $250.00 or less per share 
as 100 shares; (2) $250.01 to $1,000.00 
per share as 40 shares; (3) $1,000.01 to 
$10,000.00 per share as 10 shares; and 
(4) $10,000.01 or more per share as one 
share. For any security that becomes an 
NMS Stock during an operative period, 
as described in Rule 600(b)(93)(iv),
11
a 
round lot is 100 shares. 
The primary listing exchange is 
required to collect and calculate 
information for an NMS stock and 
provide such information, including an 
indicator of the applicable round lot 
size, to competing consolidators and 
self-aggregators.
12
Adjustments to the 
round lot size for a security will occur 
on a semiannual basis and the 
calculation of the average closing price 
on the primary listing exchange will be 
based on a one month ‘‘Evaluation 
Period.’’ 
In various sections of its rulebook, the 
Exchange currently defines round lot 
and ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ as 100. 
Specifically, Nasdaq Rule 5005(a)(40) 
defines round lot and ‘‘normal unit of

the proposed rule change, along with a brief 
description and text of the proposed rule change, 
at least five business days prior to the date of filing 
of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time

trading’’ as 100 shares of a security 
unless, with respect to a particular 
security, Nasdaq determines that a 
normal unit of trading shall constitute 
other than 100 shares. The Exchange 
proposes to amend the rule to define the 
terms pursuant to Rule 600(b)(93) of Reg 
NMS under the Act. Additionally, the 
Exchange proposes to add language that 
it shall publish semi-annual updates of 
the round lot unit for all Nasdaq-listed 
securities. 
The Exchange’s rulebook also 
references 100 shares for round lot and 
‘‘normal unit of trading’’ in Nasdaq Rule 
5720(c)(6), which currently requires 
Trust Issued Receipts to only be made 
in round lots of 100 receipts or round 
lot multiples. The Exchange proposes to 
remove the reference to 100 receipts. 
‘‘Normal Unit of Trading’’ is also 
defined in Nasdaq Equity Rule 2, 
Section 5(a)(1) as 100 shares. The 
Exchange proposes to remove the 
reference to 100 shares and add 
language noting that the Exchange shall 
publish semi-annual updates of the 
round lot unit for all Nasdaq-listed 
securities. Similarly, Nasdaq Equity 
Rule 4, Section 4703(b)(1) defines round 
lot and ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ as 100 
shares in most instances. The Exchange 
proposes to remove the reference to 100 
shares. 
These proposed changes will bring 
the rules discussed above into 
compliance with Reg NMS Rule 
600(b)(93) by eliminating references to 
100 shares as the normal unit of trading. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
13
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
14
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Generally speaking, it is consistent 
with the Act to amend the Rulebook to 
comply with securities laws and 
regulations. The Exchange believes that 
the proposed amendments made in this 
filing are reasonable because they bring 
the rules into compliance with new Reg 
NMS Rule 600(b)(93). In order to bring 
these existing rules into compliance, the 
Exchange is modifying all references in 
the rulebook that define round lot and 
‘‘normal unit of trading’’ as 100. The 
proposed changes remove any confusion 
that 100 is the default round lot size for 
all securities. The proposal also perfects 
the mechanism of a free and open 
market by making clear that the terms 
round lot and ‘‘normal unit of trading’’ 
are based on Rule 600(b)(93) of Reg 
NMS and that the Exchange will publish 
the round lot unit for all of its listed 
securities on a semi-annual basis. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed updates will protect investors 
and the public because it brings our 
rules into compliance and aligns them 
with federal securities laws and 
regulations. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
The proposal does not impose any 
burden on competition. However, even 
if these proposed amendments to the 
definition of round lot and ‘‘normal unit 
of trading’’ imposed a burden on 
competition, such a burden would be 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act because these 
changes are being made to bring the 
Exchange’s rulebook into compliance 
with new Reg NMS Rule 600(b)(93). 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The Exchange has filed the proposed 
rule change pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
15
and Rule 
19b–4(f)(6) thereunder.
16
Because the 
proposed rule change does not: (i) 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) 
impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) become operative 
prior to 30 days from the date on which 
it was filed, or such shorter time as the 
Commission may designate, if 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest, the 
proposed rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
17
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii) 
thereunder.
18
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
19
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
20
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the Exchange 
may promptly align its rules with 
current federal securities laws and 
regulations, particularly Rule 600(b)(93) 
of Reg NMS, which took effect in 
November 2025.
21
For these reasons, 
and because the proposed rule change 
does not raise any new or novel 
regulatory issues, the Commission finds 
that waiving the 30-day operative delay 
is consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and 
designates the proposed rule change as 
operative upon filing.
22
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)
23
of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act. 
Comments may be submitted by any of 
the following methods:

and Immediate Effectiveness of a 
Proposed Rule Change To Amend Rule 
14.13 (Company Listing Fees) 
December 22, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
16, 2025, Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘BZX’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (‘‘BZX’’ or 
the ‘‘Exchange’’) is filing with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’ or ‘‘SEC’’) a proposal to 
amend 14.13 (Company Listing Fees) to 
(1) explicitly state that an issuer will be 
charged the lowest of the applicable 
annual listing fees when multiple fee 
categories could apply to the issuer’s 
securities, and (2) clarify the timing of 
annual fee assessments by specifying 
that the Exchange assesses all annual 
fees upon initial listing and annually in 
the first quarter of each calendar year. 
The text of the proposed rule change is 
provided in Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/equities/ 
regulation/rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange is proposing to amend 
Rule 14.13 (Company Listing Fees) to 
provide clarification and codify existing 
Exchange practices regarding the 
assessment of annual listing fees. 
Specifically, the proposed amendments 
will: (1) explicitly state that an issuer 
will be charged the lowest of the 
applicable annual listing fees when 
multiple fee categories could apply to 
the issuer’s securities, and (2) clarify the 
timing of annual fee assessments by 
specifying that the Exchange assesses all 
annual fees upon initial listing and 
annually in the first quarter of each 
calendar year. 
These amendments are intended to 
address potential ambiguity in the 
current rule text and ensure that the 
Exchange’s fee schedule is transparent 
and easily understood by current and 
prospective issuers. The proposed 
changes do not alter the Exchange’s 
existing fee structure or introduce new 
fees; rather, they codify practices that 
the Exchange has consistently applied 
in administering annual listing fees. 
First, the clarification that issuers will 
be charged the lowest applicable annual 
listing fee addresses situations where an 
issuer’s securities may fall into multiple 
fee categories under Rule 14.13. By 
explicitly stating that the Exchange will 
apply the most favorable fee structure, 
the proposed amendment eliminates 
any potential confusion and ensures 
consistent, predictable treatment of all 
issuers. This practice is already 
followed by the Exchange and aligning 
the rule text with operational practice 
benefits issuers by providing certainty 
regarding their fee obligations. 
Second, the clarification regarding the 
timing of annual fee assessments 
provides issuers with clear guidance on 
when fees will be invoiced and due. 
This timing has been the Exchange’s 
longstanding practice and codifying it in 
the rule text enhances transparency and 
allows issuers to better plan and budget 
for their listing expenses. The proposed 
language does not change when or how 
fees are assessed; it simply makes the 
existing practice explicit in the rule. 
Listed and prospective issuers will 
benefit from increased clarity and 
transparency regarding annual listing 
fees. The explicit statement that the 
lowest applicable fee will be charged 
provides certainty and may reduce 
inquiries or disputes regarding fee 
assessments. The timing clarification 
allows issuers to anticipate when 
annual fees will be invoiced, facilitating 
financial planning. No issuer will 
experience an increase in fees as a result 
of these amendments. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
3
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
4
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation

and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
5
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers as 
well as Section 6(b)(4)
6
as it is designed 
to provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among its Members and other persons 
using its facilities. 
In particular, the proposed rule 
change promotes just and equitable 
principles of trade and removes 
impediments to a free and open market 
by enhancing transparency and 
eliminating potential ambiguity in the 
Exchange’s annual listing fee structure. 
By explicitly codifying that issuers will 
be charged the lowest applicable annual 
listing fee when multiple fee categories 
could apply, the proposed amendment 
ensures that all issuers receive 
consistent and predictable treatment. 
This clarity reduces the potential for 
confusion or disputes regarding fee 
assessments and ensures that issuers are 
not subject to arbitrary or inconsistent 
fee determinations. Transparent and 
predictable fee structures facilitate 
informed decision-making by issuers 
when selecting a listing venue, thereby 
promoting competition among 
exchanges and contributing to the 
efficient operation of the national 
market system. 
The proposed rule change protects 
investors and the public interest by 
ensuring that listed companies have 
clear visibility into their ongoing listing 
obligations and costs. This stability 
benefits investors by reducing the risk of 
unexpected delistings or financial strain 
on issuers due to unanticipated fee 
assessments. Additionally, by codifying 
the timing of annual fee assessments the 
proposed amendment provides issuers 
with the information necessary to plan 
for these obligations, further 
contributing to listing stability and 
investor protection. 
The proposed rule change is 
consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the 
Act because it provides for the equitable 
allocation of reasonable fees among 
issuers using the Exchange’s listing 
facilities. By explicitly stating that the 
Exchange will charge the lowest 
applicable fee when multiple categories 
could apply, the amendment ensures 
that no issuer is disadvantaged or 
charged a higher fee than warranted by 
the characteristics of its securities. This 
approach treats similarly situated 
issuers consistently and ensures that fee 
assessments are based on objective 
criteria rather than subjective 
interpretation. The clarification of fee 
timing similarly promotes equitable 
treatment by ensuring all issuers are 
assessed fees on the same schedule, 
eliminating any potential for 
preferential or discriminatory treatment 
in the timing of fee invoicing. 
The proposed rule change does not 
permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers in 
accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the 
Act. The amendments apply uniformly 
to all issuers listed on the Exchange and 
do not create different standards or 
treatment for different classes of issuers. 
By codifying that the lowest applicable 
fee will be charged, the Exchange is 
ensuring that all issuers benefit equally 
from this clarification, regardless of size, 
industry, or other characteristics. The 
timing clarification similarly applies 
uniformly to all issuers, ensuring 
consistent treatment across the 
Exchange’s listing population. 
Finally, the proposed rule change 
removes impediments to and perfects 
the mechanism of a free and open 
market by reducing administrative 
burdens and potential friction in the 
listing process. Clear, unambiguous 
rules regarding fee assessments allow 
issuers to focus on their business 
operations and capital formation 
activities rather than navigating 
uncertainty about listing costs. This 
efficiency benefits the broader market 
by facilitating capital formation and 
ensuring that exchanges can attract and 
retain listings based on the merits of 
their services rather than confusion 
about fee structures. Moreover, because 
the proposed amendments codify 
existing Exchange practices rather than 
introducing new requirements, they 
impose no new burdens on issuers 
while providing the benefits of 
enhanced clarity and transparency. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
proposed amendments are clarifications 
that codify existing Exchange practices 
and do not alter the substantive fee 
structure or create new obligations for 
any market participant. 
The proposed rule change does not 
impose any burden on intramarket 
competition. The amendments apply 
uniformly to all issuers listed or seeking 
to list on the Exchange, regardless of 
issuer size, industry, security type, or 
other characteristics. By explicitly 
codifying that the Exchange will charge 
the lowest applicable annual listing fee 
when multiple fee categories could 
apply, the proposed rule change ensures 
consistent and equitable treatment of all 
issuers. No category of issuer is 
advantaged or disadvantaged relative to 
other issuers as a result of these 
clarifications. The timing clarification 
similarly applies uniformly to all 
issuers, ensuring that annual fees are 
assessed on the same schedule for all 
market participants. Because the 
amendments codify existing practices 
rather than introducing new 
requirements or fee structures, no issuer 
will experience any change in 
competitive position relative to other 
issuers on the Exchange. 
The proposed rule change does not 
impose any burden on intermarket 
competition. The amendments enhance 
transparency and clarity regarding the 
Exchange’s annual listing fee structure 
and assessment timing, which may 
make the Exchange’s fee schedule more 
easily understood by prospective issuers 
comparing listing venues. To the extent 
that increased transparency benefits 
issuers listed on the Exchange, this 
reflects legitimate competition among 
exchanges based on the clarity and 
predictability of their fee structures. 
Issuers are free to choose among 
competing listing venues based on their 
evaluation of fees, services, and other 
factors. Other exchanges remain free to 
adopt similar clarifications to their own 
fee schedules or to compete on other 
dimensions of listing services. The 
proposed amendments do not create 
barriers to competition or prevent other 
exchanges from offering competitive 
listing services. 
The proposed rule change does not 
involve the Exchange undertaking 
activities usually performed by other 
market participants. The amendments 
relate solely to the Exchange’s 
administration of its own listing fee 
schedule, which is a core exchange 
function. No broker-dealer, service 
provider, or other market participant is 
displaced or burdened by these 
clarifications. 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change will relieve any 
burden on, or otherwise promote, 
competition. By enhancing transparency 
and eliminating potential ambiguity in

the Exchange’s fee structure, the 
proposed amendments facilitate more 
informed decision-making by issuers 
when selecting a listing venue. Clear, 
predictable fee structures allow issuers 
to compare listing costs across 
exchanges more easily, thereby 
promoting competition among 
exchanges based on the merits of their 
services and fee structures. The explicit 
codification that the Exchange will 
charge the lowest applicable fee when 
multiple categories could apply 
demonstrates the Exchange’s 
commitment to fair and transparent 
pricing, which may enhance the 
Exchange’s competitive position based 
on the quality and clarity of its fee 
schedule rather than on confusion or 
ambiguity. This type of competition— 
based on transparency, predictability, 
and fair treatment—benefits issuers and 
contributes to the efficient operation of 
the national market system.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
ISE proposes to amend its SQF Port 
pricing at Options 7, Section 7, C, ‘‘Ports 
and Other Services’’ by offering an 
incentive to Market Makers
5
to lower 
their SQF Port Fees. 
Currently, ISE assesses an SQF Port 
Fee of $1,185 per port, per month. At 
this time, the Exchange proposes to offer 
an opportunity to lower SQF Port Fees. 
Specifically, the Exchange proposes to 
offer certain discounts to Market Makers 
that have transacted a certain percentage 
of Total National Volume in the prior 
month. For purposes of this proposal, 
the percentage of Total National Volume 
is calculated by taking the total Market 
Maker Penny Symbol and Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume (excluding 
index options) executed on the 
Exchange in the prior month and 
attributing a multiple of five times to 
that Non-Penny Symbol volume 
(numerator) and dividing that by Market 
Maker volume (‘‘M’’ capacity at The 
Options Clearing Corporation (‘‘OCC’’)) 
in multiply listed options across all 
options exchanges (denominator or 
Total National Volume). 
Tier Percentage of total national volume Percentage SQF port discount 1 ........................ less than 0.10 .......................................................................................................................... 0 2 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.10% and less than 0.25% ............................................................. 10 3 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.25% and less than 0.40% ............................................................. 30 4 ........................ greater than or equal to 0.40% ................................................................................................ 50 With this proposal, a Market Maker 
that transacted less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
would not receive a discount on SQF 
Port Fees. A Market Maker that 
transacted greater than or equal to 
0.10% and less than 0.25% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 10% on 
their SQF Port Fees. A Market Maker 
that transacted greater than or equal to 
0.25% and less than 0.40% of Total 
National Volume in the prior month 
will be afforded a discount of 30% on 
their SQF Port Fees. Finally, a Market 
Maker that transacted greater than or 
equal to 0.40% of Total National 
Volume in the prior month will be 
afforded a discount of 50% on their SQF 
Port Fees. By way of example, a Market 
Maker that executed 3,000,000 in Penny 
Volume and 200,000 in Non-Penny 
Volume in a given month on the 
Exchange, where the Total National 
Volume was 1,000,000,000, would 
qualify for a discount of 50% on their 
SQF Port Fees ((200,000 × 5= 1,000,000) + 3,000,000 = 4,000,000 which is 0.40% 
of 1,000,000,000). 
The Exchange proposes to calculate 
Market Maker Non-Penny Symbol 
volume at five times the weight as 
compared to Market Maker Penny 
Symbol volume because Non-Penny 
Symbols tend to have lower volumes 
and this incentive should encourage a 
greater amount of volume in Non-Penny 
Symbols. Overall, the proposed 
discounts should encourage Market 
Makers to transact additional order flow 
on ISE with which other market 
participants may interact, for an 
opportunity to lower SQF Port Fees. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally 
not multiply listed. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
6
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
7
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
8
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
9
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
10
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
11
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’. . ..’’
12
Although the court and 
the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The proposed fee discounts for ISE 
SQF Ports are reasonable because they 
will attract a greater amount of order 
flow to ISE with which other market 
participants may interact while also 
lowering costs for certain Market 
Makers that are able to transact greater 
than 0.10% of Total National Volume in 
the prior month. The Exchange believes 
it is reasonable to lower costs for certain 
Market Makers that transact greater than 
0.10% of Total National Volume on ISE 
because those Market Makers are 
affording other ISE Members an 
opportunity to interact with that order 
flow. The proposal provides an

Cboe currently offers its market makers credits 
on their monthly BOE Bulk Port Fees. Specifically, 
if a Cboe market maker affiliate (‘‘affiliate’’ defined 
as having at least 75% common ownership between 
the two entities as reflected on each entity’s Form 
BD, Schedule A) or Cboe Appointed OFP receives 
a credit under the Exchange’s Volume Incentive 
Program (‘‘VIP’’), the Cboe market maker will 
receive an access credit on their BOE Bulk Ports 
corresponding to the VIP tier reached. The credit is 
based on the Performance Tier earned by a market 
maker under Cboe’s Liquidity Provider Sliding 
Scale Adjustment Table. Tiers 4 and 5 earn a 40% 
credit on monthly Cboe Bulk Port Fees. Cboe 
assesses BOE Bulk Logical Ports a fee of $1,500 for 
1 to 5 ports, a fee of $2,500 for 6 to 30 ports and 
a fee of $3,000 for over 30 ports. Additionally, each 
BOE Bulk Logical Port will incur the logical port 
fee indicated when used to enter up to 30,000,000 
orders per trading day per logical port as measured 
on average in a single month. Each incremental 
usage of up to 30,000,000 orders per day per BOE 
Bulk Logical Port will incur an additional logical 
port fee of $3,000 per month. Incremental usage 
will be determined on a monthly basis based on the 
average orders per day entered in a single month 
across all subscribed BOE Bulk Logical Ports. 
14
Penny Symbols typically are more liquid 
symbols. 
15
For example, an ISE Market Maker may desire 
to utilize multiple SQF Ports for accounting 
purposes, to measure performance, for regulatory 
reasons or other determinations that are specific to 
that Member. 
16
ISE Market Makers have various regulatory 
requirements as provided for in Options 2, Section 
4. Additionally, ISE Market Makers have certain 
quoting requirements with respect to their assigned 
options series as provided in Options 2, Section 5. 
SQF Ports are the only quoting protocol available 
on ISE and only Market Makers may utilize SQF 
Ports. 
17
See ISE Options 2, Section 5. 18
See ISE Options 2, Section 4. 19
See ISE Options 2, Section 4(b). 20
See ISE Options 2, Section 5. 21
See ISE Options 2, Section 4. 22
See ISE Options 2, Section 4(b). incremental incentive for Market 
Makers that transact at least 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, which provides 
a higher benefit for satisfying 
increasingly more stringent criteria. The 
Exchange believes that the value of the 
proposed discounts is commensurate 
with the difficulty to achieve the 
corresponding threshold. Additionally, 
the discounts may incentivize and 
attract more volume and liquidity to the 
Exchange, which will benefit all 
Exchange participants through 
increased opportunities to trade as well 
as enhancing price discovery. The 
Exchange’s proposed discounts are 
substantially similar to Cboe Exchange, 
Inc.’s (‘‘Cboe’’) credit for their BOE Bulk 
Port Fees.
13
 
ISE believes it is reasonable to offer 
fee discounts to those Market Makers 
that primarily provide and post 
liquidity to the Exchange, as it should 
encourage Market Makers to continue to 
participate on the Exchange and add 
liquidity. Greater liquidity benefits all 
market participants by providing more 
trading opportunities and tighter 
spreads. The proposal would also 
mitigate the costs incurred by Market 
Makers on ISE. 
Calculating Market Maker Non-Penny 
Symbol volume at five times the weight 
as compared to Penny Symbol volume 
is reasonable, equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as Non-Penny Symbols 
tend to have lower volumes and this 
incentive should encourage a greater 
amount of volume in Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbols.
14
The Exchange 
proposes to calculate the Market Maker 
Non-Penny Symbol volume in an 
uniform manner for all Members. The 
Exchange proposes to exclude index 
options as index options are generally 
not multiply listed. Index Options 
would be uniformly excluded. 
An ISE Market Maker requires only 
one SQF Port to submit quotes in its 
assigned options series into ISE. An ISE 
Market Maker may submit all quotes 
through one SQF Port. While an ISE 
Market Maker may elect to obtain 
multiple SQF Ports to organize its 
business,
15
only one SQF Port is 
necessary for an ISE Market Maker to 
fulfill its regulatory quoting 
obligations.
16
 
The proposed fee discounts for ISE 
SQF Ports are equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory as they would apply 
uniformly to each ISE Market Maker. 
The Exchange would uniformly 
calculate the Market Maker’s percentage 
each month. Although only Market 
Makers may receive the proposed 
discounts, the Exchange notes that 
Market Makers are valuable market 
participants that provide liquidity in the 
marketplace and incur costs that other 
market participants do not incur. Unlike 
other market participants, Market 
Makers are required to provide 
continuous two-sided quotes on a daily 
basis,
17
and are subject to various 
obligations associated with providing 
liquidity.
18
While the Exchange is not 
offering a discount to those Market 
Makers that transact less than 0.10% of 
Total National Volume, the Exchange 
notes that these Market Makers transact 
a much lower amount of contracts on 
ISE as compared to other Market Makers 
who qualify for a discount. In some 
cases, these Market Makers are not 
executing the requisite amount of Penny 
Symbols or Non-Penny Symbols to 
obtain the discount. Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers to improve the market in all 
series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed and to 
update market quotations in response to 
changed market conditions in all series 
of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed.
19
The Exchange 
believes that all Market Makers are 
capable of quoting tighter or in a greater 
amount of options classes to obtain the 
requisite volume to achieve a discount. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
In terms of intra-market competition, 
the proposed fee discounts for ISE SQF 
Ports do not impose a burden on 
competition because they would apply 
uniformly to each ISE Market Maker and 
the Exchange would uniformly calculate 
the Market Maker’s percentage each 
month. Although only Market Makers 
may receive the proposed discounts, the 
Exchange notes that Market Makers are 
valuable market participants that 
provide liquidity in the marketplace and 
incur costs that other market 
participants do not incur. Unlike other 
market participants, Market Makers are 
required to provide continuous two- 
sided quotes on a daily basis,
20
and are 
subject to various obligations associated 
with providing liquidity.
21
Further, 
while the Exchange is not offering a 
discount to those Market Makers that 
transact less than 0.10% of Total 
National Volume, the Exchange notes 
that these Market Makers transact a 
much lower amount of contracts on ISE 
as compared to other Market Makers 
that qualify for the discount and/or 
these Market Makers are not executing 
the requisite amount of Penny Symbols 
or Non-Penny Symbols to obtain the 
discount. The Exchange’s proposal does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition because Market Makers are 
required to compete with other Market 
Makers to improve the market in all 
series of options classes to which the 
Market Maker is appointed and to 
update market quotations in response to 
changed market conditions in all series 
of options classes to which the Market 
Maker is appointed.
22
The Exchange 
believes that all Market Makers are 
capable of quoting tighter or in a greater 
amount of options classes to obtain the 
requisite volume to achieve a discount. 
In terms of inter-market competition, 
the Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its

options exchanges. In addition to the 
Exchange, market participants have 
alternative options exchanges that they 
may participate on and direct their 
order flow. In sum, if the changes 
proposed herein are unattractive to 
market participants, it is likely that the 
Exchange will lose market share as a 
result. Accordingly, the Exchange does 
not believe that the proposed changes 
will impair the ability of members or 
competing options exchanges to 
maintain their competitive standing in 
the financial markets.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
22, 2025, Nasdaq ISE, LLC (‘‘ISE’’ or 
‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’ or 
‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to adopt a 
Best Execution and Interpositioning rule 
at proposed Options 9, Section 26. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/ise/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to adopt a 
Best Execution and Interpositioning rule 
at proposed Options 9, Section 26 that 
is identical to Nasdaq Phlx LLC (‘‘Phlx’’) 
Best Execution and Interpositioning rule 
at General 9, Section 11. 
Background 
A broker-dealer has a legal duty to 
seek best execution of customer orders. 
The duty of best execution predates the 
Federal securities laws and is derived 
from an implied representation that a 
broker-dealer makes to its customers. 
The duty is established from ‘‘common 
law agency obligations of undivided 
loyalty and reasonable care that an agent 
owes to [its] principal.’’
3
This 
obligation requires that a ‘‘broker-dealer 
seek to obtain for its customer orders the 
most favorable terms reasonably 
available under the circumstances.’’
4
 
The duty of best execution is addressed 
at FINRA Rule 5310. 
The Commission has previously 
stated that the duty of best execution 
requires a broker-dealer to execute 
customers’ trades at the most favorable 
terms reasonably available under the 
circumstances, i.e., at the best reasonably available price.
5
The 
Commission has described a non- 
exhaustive list of factors that may be

favorable price for his customer, where he 
interposes another broker-dealer between himself

under the circumstances’’).

relevant to broker-dealers’ best 
execution analysis. These factors 
include the size of the order, speed of 
execution, clearing costs, the trading 
characteristics of the security involved, 
the availability of accurate information 
affecting choices as to the most 
favorable market center for execution 
and the availability of technological aids 
to process such information, and the 
cost and difficulty associated with 
achieving an execution in a particular 
market center.
6
 
In addition, the Commission has 
expressed concerns regarding 
interpositioning and the duty of best 
execution. Interpositioning can occur 
when a broker-dealer places a third 
party between itself and the best market 
for executing a customer trade in a 
manner that results in a customer not 
receiving the best available market 
price.
7
Interpositioning can violate the 
broker-dealer’s duty of best execution 
when it results in unnecessary 
transaction costs at the expense of the 
customer.
8
 
Proposal 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
codify the broker dealer’s duty of best 
execution at Options 9, Section 26 and 
title the new rule, ‘‘Best Execution and 
Interpositioning.’’ 
A broker-dealer that engages in a 
transaction for or with a customer or a 
customer of another broker-dealer, a 
Member and persons associated with a 
Member shall use reasonable diligence 
to ascertain the best market for the 
subject security and buy or sell in such 
market so that the resultant price to the 
customer is as favorable as possible 
under prevailing market conditions. 
Utilizing the Commission’s non- 
exhaustive list of factors, FINRA Rule 
5310 and identical to Phlx General 9, 
Section 11, the following are among the 
factors that will be considered in 
determining whether a Member has 
used ‘‘reasonable diligence’’ are: 
D the character of the market for the security, e.g., price, volatility, relative liquidity, and pressure on available 
communications; 
D the size and type of transaction; D the number of markets checked; D accessibility of the quotation; and D the terms and conditions of the order which result in the transaction, as 
communicated to the Member and 
persons associated with the Member.
9
 
To prevent a broker-dealer from 
avoiding its best execution obligation 
via a third-party, the Exchange proposes 
to state that in any transaction for or 
with a customer or a customer of 
another broker-dealer, no Member or 
person associated with a Member shall 
interject a third party between the 
Member and the best market for the 
subject security in a manner 
inconsistent with paragraph (a)(1) of 
this Rule.
10
 
Next, the Exchange notes that it is the 
Member’s obligation to demonstrate best 
execution. To this end, the Exchange 
proposes to state that when a Member 
cannot execute directly with a market 
maker but must employ a broker’s 
broker or some other means in order to 
ensure an execution advantageous to the 
customer, the burden of showing the 
acceptable circumstances for doing so is 
on the retail firm. Examples of 
acceptable circumstances are where a 
customer’s order is ‘‘crossed’’ with 
another retail firm which has a 
corresponding order on the other side, 
or where the identity of the retail firm, 
if known, would likely cause undue 
price movements adversely affecting the 
cost or proceeds to the customer.
11
 
The Exchange further notes that a 
Member cannot using staffing or a third 
party as a reason to not execute a 
transaction in accordance with its best 
execution obligation. The Exchange 
proposes to state that failure to maintain 
or adequately staff a department 
assigned to execute customers’ orders 
cannot be considered justification for 
executing away from the best available 
market; nor can channeling orders 
through a third party as described above 
as reciprocation for service or business 
operate to relieve a Member of its 
obligations.
12
The proposed rule does 
however advise that certain executions 
where orders are channeled and there 
are established correspondent 
relationships or a give-up relationship 
to meet the requirements of best 
obligation if the executions are 
confirmed directly to the Member acting 
as agent for the customer. The Exchange 
proposes to state that the channeling of 
customers’ orders through a broker’s 
broker or third party pursuant to 
established correspondent relationships 
under which executions are confirmed 
directly to the Member acting as agent 
for the customer, such as where the 
third party gives up the name of the 
retail firm, are not prohibited if the cost 
of such service is not borne by the 
customer.
13
 
The proposed rule also holds 
Members responsible where they are a 
party to the transaction chain where the 
best execution obligation was not met. 
The Exchange proposes to state that a 
Member through whom a retail order is 
channeled, as described above, and who 
knowingly is a party to an arrangement 
whereby the initiating Member has not 
fulfilled his obligations under this Rule, 
will also be deemed to have violated 
Options 9, Section 26.
14
 
A Member is subject the duty of best 
execution where it acts as agent for the

17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) requires a self-regulatory organization to give 
the Commission written notice of its intent to file 
the proposed rule change at least five business days 
prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule 
change, or such shorter time as designated by the 
Commission. The Exchange has satisfied this 
requirement. 
certain interpretive questions 
concerning the applicability of the best 
execution rule. 
The Exchange proposes to note, 
identical to Phlx General 9, Section 11, 
that for the purposes of this Rule, the 
term ‘‘market’’ or ‘‘markets’’ is to be 
construed broadly, and it encompasses 
a variety of different venues, including, 
but not limited to, market centers that 
are trading a particular security. The 
rule text notes that this expansive 
interpretation is meant to both inform 
broker/dealers as to the breadth of the 
scope of venues that must be considered 
in the furtherance of their best 
execution obligations and to promote 
fair competition among broker/dealers, 
exchange markets, and markets other 
than exchange markets, as well as any 
other venue that may emerge, by not 
mandating that certain trading venues 
have less relevance than others in the 
course of determining a firm’s best 
execution obligations. 
Finally, identical to Phlx General 9, 
Section 11, the Exchange provides that 
a Member’s duty to provide best 
execution in any transaction ‘‘for or 
with a customer of another broker/ 
dealer’’ does not apply in instances 
when another broker/dealer is simply 
executing a customer order against the 
Member’s quote. The duty to provide 
best execution to customer orders 
received from other broker/dealers 
arises only when an order is routed from 
the broker/dealer to the Member for the 
purpose of order handling and 
execution. Identical to Phlx, this rule 
text is intended to draw a distinction 
between those situations in which the 
Member is acting solely as the buyer or 
seller in connection with orders 
presented by a broker/dealer against the 
Member’s quote, as opposed to those 
circumstances in which the Member is 
accepting order flow from another 
broker/dealer for the purpose of 
facilitating the handling and execution 
of such orders. 
Members are subject to this rule today 
by virtue of having public customers. 
Brokers with public customers are 
required to be members of FINRA; 
accordingly, adoption of these rules by 
ISE could be seen as unnecessary. 
However, ISE believes that the 
requirements of these rules are 
sufficiently important that they should 
be reinforced through explicit inclusion 
in its rules. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
17
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,
18
 
in particular, in that it is designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general to protect 
investors and the public interest, by 
adopting a best execution and 
interpositioning rule at Options 9, 
Section 26 to inform Members of their 
obligations with respect to their 
customers. 
ISE’s proposed Options 9, Section 26 
seeks to make clear that a broker-dealer 
must seek to obtain for its customer 
orders the most favorable terms 
reasonably available under the 
circumstances, thereby protecting 
investors and general public. The 
proposal promotes just and equitable 
principles of trade by providing 
examples of reasonable diligence and 
identifying use of channeling and third 
parties that are and are not violative of 
the rule. ISE’s interpretation of the term 
‘‘market’’ or ‘‘markets’’ is intended to 
provide Members with context as to the 
scope of venues that must be considered 
in the furtherance of their best 
execution obligations. Finally, the 
Exchange notes that the duty to provide 
best execution to customer orders 
received from other broker/dealers 
arises only when an order is routed from 
the broker/dealer to the Member for the 
purpose of order handling and 
execution. Finally, the Exchange 
intends to harmonize ISE’s rule with 
Phlx General 9, Section 11 which is 
identical to the proposed rule. 
Members are subject to these rules 
today by virtue of having public 
customers. Brokers with public 
customers are required to be members of 
FINRA; accordingly, adoption of these 
rules by ISE could be seen as 
unnecessary. However, ISE believes that 
the requirements of these rules are 
sufficiently important that they should 
be reinforced through explicit inclusion 
in its rules. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange’s proposal to adopt a 
new Options 9, Section 26, Best 
Execution and Interpositioning, does 
not impose an undue burden on 
competition as all Members that 
conduct business with the public would 
be subject to the proposed rule. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were either 
solicited or received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
19
and 
subparagraph (f)(6) of Rule 19b–4 
thereunder.
20
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
should be approved or disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Fixed 
Income Clearing Corporation; Order 
Approving Proposed Rule Change To 
Modify the GSD Rulebook Relating to 
a New Service Offering Called the ACS 
Triparty Service 
December 22, 2025. 
I. Introduction 
On September 19, 2025, Fixed Income 
Clearing Corporation (‘‘FICC’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) proposed 
rule change SR–FICC–2025–021, 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’)
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder.
2
 
The Proposed Rule Change would 
modify FICC’s Government Securities 
Division (‘‘GSD’’) Rule Book
3
(the 
‘‘Rules’’) to create a new service offering 
called the ACS Triparty Service. The 
Proposed Rule Change was published 
for comment in the Federal Register on 
September 30, 2025.
4
The Commission 
has received no comments on the 
changes proposed. 
On November 3, 2025, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
5
the 
Commission designated a longer period 
within which to approve, disapprove, or 
institute proceedings to determine 
whether to approve or disapprove the 
Proposed Rule Change.
6
 
For the reasons discussed below, the 
Commission is approving the Proposed 
Rule Change. 
II. Background 
FICC is a central counterparty 
(‘‘CCP’’), which means it interposes 
itself as the buyer to every seller and 
seller to every buyer for the financial 
transactions it clears. FICC’s GSD 
provides trade comparison, netting, risk 
management, settlement and CCP 
services for the U.S. Government 
securities market. 
A. FICC’s Indirect Participant Access 
Models 
In 2024, FICC consolidated its 
existing correspondent clearing and 
prime broker services into a single 
‘‘Agent Clearing Service.’’
7
The new 
service allows certain Netting Members, 
known as ‘‘Agent Clearing Members,’’ to 
submit any transaction calling for the 
delivery of Eligible Securities with the 
exception of Netting Eligible Auction 
Purchases, GCF Repo Transactions, and 
CCIT Transactions (each, an ‘‘Agent 
Clearing Transaction’’) to FICC for 
comparison, novation, netting and 
settlement purposes.
8
Each Agent 
Clearing Transaction is entered into by 
an Indirect Participant (known as an 
‘‘Executing Firm Customer’’) with an 
Agent Clearing Member (a ‘‘done-with’’ 
transaction), or with a different Netting 
Member, or any Sponsored Member or 
Executing Firm Customer of any Netting 
Member (‘‘done-away’’).
9
While the 
Agent Clearing Member acts solely as 
the agent of the Executing Firm 
Customer, it remains fully liable to FICC 
for all obligations associated with the 
Agent Clearing Transactions.
10
 
FICC states that the Agent Clearing 
Service is designed to provide an 
avenue of access to FICC’s clearance and 
settlement systems for indirect 
participants unable to onboard directly 
with FICC due to regulatory, cost, legal, 
operational or jurisdictional reasons.
11
 
Furthermore, Clearing Fund 
requirements for Agent Clearing 
Transactions are ‘‘calculated on a net 
basis across all Executing Firm 
Customers whose transactions are 
recorded within the same Account,’’ 
which results in lower margin 
obligations than the GSD Sponsored 
Membership Service (‘‘Sponsored 
Service’’).
12
 
The Agent Clearing Service allows 
Members to perfect their security 
interests in an Agent Clearing 
Transactions without filing a financing 
statement. According to an industry 
opinion obtained by SIFMA, the level of 
intermediation present in the Service 
means a court would treat Agent 
Clearing Transactions as ‘‘financial 
assets’’ in a ‘‘securities account,’’ with 
the Agent Clearing Member acting as the 
‘‘securities intermediary’’ under New 
York’s UCC Article 8. Under Articles 8 
and 9, this automatically perfects the 
securities intermediary’s interest and 
eliminates the need for the costly and 
time-consuming filing of a financing 
statement.
13
The Agent Clearing Service 
and the Sponsored Service are the two 
principal Indirect Participant access 
models offered by FICC. Under the 
Sponsored Service, a Netting Member of 
FICC (the ‘‘Sponsoring Member’’) can 
sponsor its customer (the ‘‘Sponsored 
Member’’) into limited membership and 
submit certain transactions for 
comparison, novation, and netting 
conducted by the Sponsored Member 
(‘‘Sponsored Member Trades’’).
14
Both 
the Agent Clearing Member and the 
Sponsoring Member function as the 
processing agent for its Sponsored 
Members or Executing Firm Customers 
regarding their trades and remains fully 
liable for the Sponsored Member or 
Executing Firm Customer’s obligations 
to FICC under these transactions.
15
 
While the Agent Clearing Service and 
Sponsored Service share similarities 
including the ability of both to 
accommodate bilateral DVP repos, there 
are specific differences in the scope of 
transactions eligible for clearing, as 
discussed further in section II.B below, 
the treatment of haircuts, and the 
novation of Start Legs.

The Proposed Rule Change edits the GSD 
Rulebook by adding new several new definitions in 
Rule 1 editing several other definitions in Rule 1, 
and making clarifying updates to Rules 3A and 5. 
The Proposed Rule Change also makes 
corresponding changes to Sections 4 and 7 of Rule 
8, adding new sections 7(c), (g), and (h). The 
Proposed Rule Change also adds new Section 8 to 
Rule 8. In addition, the Proposed Rule Change adds 
a new Schedule of ACS Triparty Trade Timeframes 
to the Rulebook and adds corresponding changes to 
the Schedule for the Deletion of Trade Data, the 
Schedule of Required and Accepted Data 
Submission Items for a Substitution of Existing 
Securities Collateral, and the Schedule of GC 
Comparable Securities. 
22
In a separate Rule Filing, FICC submitted a 
Default Management proposal which would amend 
Rule 8 to describe mechanisms that would permit 
ACM to liquidate the positions of an Executing 
Firm Customer. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 103282 (June 17, 2025), 90 FR 26656 
(June 23, 2025) (SR–FICC–2025–015). See also

Management Proposal. See Notice of Filing, supra note 4, 90 FR 47045 at 47048.

Id at 47047–8. governing the Agent Clearing Service do 
not address the treatment of Initial 
Haircuts under Agent Clearing 
Transactions, whereas transactions with 
Initial Haircuts in the Sponsored 
Service are considered ‘‘Off-The-Market 
Transactions.’’ As for the novation of 
Start Legs on Same-Day Settling Trades, 
unlike in the Sponsored Service where 
FICC expressly does not novate the Start 
Leg of Sponsored Member Trades, the 
Rules provide for FICC to novate the 
Start Leg of done-with repo transactions 
submitted via the Agent Clearing 
Service. 
B. FICC’s Agent Clearing Service and 
Indirect Participant Triparty Repos 
The Agent Clearing Service does not 
currently support Repo Transactions on 
securities represented by Generic CUSIP 
Numbers that settle through a clearing 
agent bank’s triparty repo platform 
(‘‘Triparty Trades’’), whereas the 
Sponsored Service includes this type of 
transaction.
17
FICC clears Triparty 
Trades between a Sponsored Member 
and its Sponsoring Member 
(‘‘Sponsored GC Trades’’) through its 
Sponsored GC Service.
18
 
Under the Sponsored GC Service, the 
securities delivery and related payment 
obligations in a Sponsored GC Trade 
settle directly between the pre-novation 
counterparties through a Sponsored GC 
Clearing Agent Bank’s triparty repo 
platform, rather than through FICC.
19
 
This can facilitate access for 
participants that are not operationally 
equipped to perform the collateral 
management and other functions 
associated with Repo Transactions that 
settle through FICC on a delivery- 
versus-payment basis (‘‘DVP Repo 
Transactions’’), or who generally prefer 
to use the triparty repo market because 
a clearing bank administers collateral 
management and other functions.
20
 
III. Description of the Proposed Rule 
Change 
The Proposed Rule Change would: (A) 
amend the FICC Government Securities 
Division Rulebook to create the ACS 
Triparty Service as a new offering under 
the Agent Clearing Service; (B) align the 
treatment of Initial Haircuts within the 
Rules for done-with Agent Clearing 
Transactions with those for done-with 
Sponsored Member Trades; (C) clarify 
that FICC does not novate the Start Legs 
of Same-Day Settling Done-With Agent 
Clearing Transactions; and (D) make 
certain conforming and clarifying 
changes.
21
 
A. The ACS Triparty Service 
The ACS Triparty Service would 
allow an Agent Clearing Member to 
submit to FICC for comparison and 
novation triparty Repo Transactions 
entered by an Executing Firm Customer 
using securities represented by Generic 
CUSIP Numbers (each, an ‘‘ACS 
Triparty Trade’’). As with other Agent 
Clearing Transactions, the Agent 
Clearing Member acts solely as agent of 
the Executing Firm Customer in 
connection with the clearing of Agent 
Clearing Transactions and remains fully 
liable to FICC for the performance of all 
obligations, financial or otherwise, 
arising in connection with these 
transactions. The Proposed Rule Change 
would accommodate transactions 
between an Executing Firm Customer 
and its Agent Clearing Member (done- 
with trades), as well as transactions 
between an Executing Firm Customer 
and another Netting Member or an 
Indirect Participant of any Netting 
Member (done-away trades). 
FICC states that ACS Triparty Trades 
would be recorded in an Agent Clearing 
Member Omnibus Account along with 
other Agent Clearing Transactions, 
unless the Executing Firm Customer and 
Agent Clearing Member choose to 
record such trades in a Segregated 
Indirect Participants Account. If 
utilizing the Agent Clearing Member 
Omnibus Account, margin on the 
transaction would be calculated in a 
way that recognizes the risk offsets 
across all open positions within the 
Account at the time. ACS Triparty 
Trades recorded in both an Agent 
Clearing Member Omnibus Account or a 
Segregated Indirect Participants 
Account would be subject to all 
applicable charges according to the 
Margin Component Schedule of the 
Rules as other Agent Clearing 
Transactions recorded in the same 
Account.
22
ACS Triparty Trades would 
be treated as GCF Repo Transactions for 
the calculation of margin, therefore 
FICC does not propose any changes to 
the calculation of the Required Fund 
Deposit or Segregated Customer Margin. 
FICC further states that they would 
incorporate ACS Triparty Trades into 
their liquidity risk management 
calculations and into the calculation of 
Agent Clearing Members’ obligations 
with respect to the Capped Contingency 
Liquidity Facility (‘‘CCLF’’)
23
in the 
same respect as Sponsored GC Trades.
24
 
The ACS Triparty Service will 
incorporate features from the extant 
Sponsored GC Service resulting in 
similar terms across both the ACS 
Triparty and Sponsored GC Service. 
FICC states that this similarity is to align 
terms across both the ACS Triparty and 
Sponsored GC Services, facilitating 
Agent Clearing Members in offering 
access to money market funds and other 
cash providers dependent on securities 
transfers for margin maintenance and 
triparty repo clearing banks for 
collateral management to access FICC’s 
clearance and settlement services.
25
 
Both services will utilize identical 
schedules of eligible securities. The 
Start Leg of transactions within both 
services will settle on a gross basis 
between pre-novation counterparties via 
the triparty repo platform of a triparty 
clearing agent bank. Upon settling the 
Start Leg and satisfying other 
conditions, the End Leg becomes 
eligible for novation. Additionally, both 
services may apply, but are not required 
to apply, an initial haircut. 
For purposes of calculating initial 
margin requirements, both services will 
treat triparty repos as GCF Repo 
Transactions. The only Funds-Only 
Settlement Amounts applicable will be 
the Forward Mark Adjustment Payment 
and Interest Rate Adjustment Payment. 
Daily accrued repo interest will be 
payable by or to FICC under both 
services. Furthermore, both allow the 
repo seller to substitute General

to the triparty trade. 
In connection with the final 
settlement, daily repo interest and 
margin calls related to mark-to-market 
movements of the triparty repo 
securities, as well as the transfer of 
these securities, will occur directly 
between pre-novation counterparties 
through the triparty repo platform of the 
clearing agent bank.
26
FICC also 
proposes to explicitly state within the 
Rules that an Agent Clearing 
Transaction involving an Initial Haircut 
is considered an ‘‘Off-the-Market 
Transaction,’’ akin to a Sponsored 
Member Trade with an Initial Haircut. 
B. The Treatment of Initial Haircuts for 
Done-With Agent Clearing Transactions 
As an Agent Clearing Member might 
post a haircut to its Executing Firm 
Customers to address regulatory and/or 
investment guideline concerns similar 
to Sponsoring Members and their 
Sponsored Members under the 
Sponsored Service, or choose to collect 
a haircut from its Executing Firm 
Customer at the Start Leg to mitigate 
exposure from full liability for 
obligations to FICC in Agent Clearing 
Transactions. However, FICC’s current 
funds-only settlement process could 
frustrate this purpose by requiring the 
recipient of a haircut at the Start Leg to 
transfer an equivalent amount of cash 
the next Business Day after the Start Leg 
has settled. 
To prevent Initial Haircuts from being 
returned before final settlement in done- 
with Agent Clearing Transactions, FICC 
proposes new Rules to align the 
treatment of Initial Haircuts under 
Agent Clearing Transactions with those 
under Sponsored Member Trades. 
Specifically, the Collateral Mark for 
these transactions will be based on the 
Initial Haircut rather than the Contract 
Price. For instance, if the Initial Haircut 
is $2 and the value of Eligible Securities 
increases by $1, FICC would calculate a 
Collateral Mark of $1 instead of $3. This 
ensures the Initial Haircut remains with 
the intended party until final 
settlement. 
Additionally, FICC plans to clarify 
that ACS Triparty Trades, like 
Sponsored GC Trades, may but are not 
required to include an Initial Haircut. 
Changes in mark-to-market values of 
Purchased GC Repo Securities for these 
trades will be passed between pre- 
Novation counterparties through the 
triparty repo platform rather than the 
Funds-Only Settlement Amount cycle, 
as in a Sponsored GC Trade. 
Finally, FICC will specify that Agent 
Clearing Transactions with an Initial 
Haircut will be treated as Off-the-Market 
Transactions, similar to Sponsored 
Member Trades. The party posting the 
Initial Haircut bears the risk of loss if 
FICC ceases to act for the pre-Novation 
counterparty. 
C. Rule Change To Clarify That FICC 
Does Not Novate the Start Legs of Same- 
Day Settling Done-With Agent Clearing 
Transactions 
FICC does not Novate the Start Legs 
of same-day starting Agent Clearing 
Transactions due to operational and 
legal complexities. Revisions to Rule 1 
will make clear that only certain Agent 
Clearing Transactions qualify as Same- 
Day Settling Trades. The only Agent 
Clearing Transaction that constitutes a 
Same-Day Settling Trade is one that: (1) 
is not an ACS Triparty Trade; (2) is 
executed between an Executing Firm 
Customer and a Netting Member or 
Indirect Participant other than its Agent 
Clearing Member; and (3) meets the 
requirements of clause (i) and (ii) of that 
definition. This aligns the treatment of 
these transactions with the Sponsored 
Service. Section 7(f) (formerly 7(e)) will 
also be updated to state that Same-Day 
Settling Trades do not settle at FICC, 
eliminating the need for notices from 
Agent Clearing Members. 
D. Proposed Technical and Conforming 
Changes 
Finally, FICC proposes several 
clarifying, conforming, and technical 
changes related to the Proposed Rule 
Changes. 
FICC intends to revise the definitions 
of ‘‘Current Haircut,’’ ‘‘Haircut Deficit,’’ 
and ‘‘Haircut Surplus’’ to specify that 
these definitions only apply to done- 
with DVP Repo Transactions. This 
distinction is necessary because FICC 
does not support Initial Haircuts for 
done-away DVP Repo Transactions, but 
only in the context of done-with DVP 
Repo Transactions. Similarly, FICC aims 
to amend Section 9 of Rule 3A to clarify 
that it incorporates Initial Haircuts into 
its calculation of Funds-Only Settlement 
Amounts solely in relation to done-with 
Sponsored Member Trades. 
Additionally, FICC would update 
Section 4 of Rule 5 to mandate that ACS 
Triparty Trades be submitted exactly as 
executed. Furthermore, Section 7(h) of 
Rule 8 would be relocated as a new 
sentence at the end of new Section 7(d). 
FICC also proposes adding a new 
Section 7(c) to Rule 8, indicating that 
ACS Triparty Trades are not subject to 
the Schedule of Timeframes applicable 
to Agent Clearing Transactions in 
general, but rather to the Schedule of 
ACS Triparty Trade Timeframes. Lastly, 
FICC proposes renumbering Section 7(e) 
of Rule 8 as Section 7(f). 
IV. Discussion and Commission 
Findings 
Section 19(b)(2)(C) of the Act
27
 
directs the Commission to approve a 
proposed rule change of a self- 
regulatory organization if it finds that 
such proposed rule change is consistent 
with the requirements of the Act and 
rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to such organization. After 
carefully considering the Proposed Rule 
Change, the Commission finds that the 
Proposed Rule Change is consistent 
with the requirements of the Act and the 
rules and regulations thereunder 
applicable to FICC. In particular, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
28
and Rules 
17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C),
29
17ad– 
22(e)(19),
30
and 17ad–22(e)(21),
31
each 
promulgated under the Act. 
A. Consistency With Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act
32
 
requires the rules of a clearing agency 
to, among other things, (i) promote the 
prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions; 
and (2) protect investors and the public 
interest. 
As outlined in Section II.A, FICC’s 
current Agent Clearing Service supports 
trading in DVP repos but not triparty 
repos. The Commission understands 
that this restriction may disadvantage 
certain market participants due to 
regulatory, operational, legal, size, or 
other constraints that limit their ability 
to access clearance and settlement 
services for triparty repos.
33
As 
discussed in part III.A, FICC proposes to 
expand the Agent Clearing Service 
through the ACS Triparty Service to 
accommodate triparty repo trading, 
where a clearing bank administers 
collateral management and other 
functions. By allowing Executing Firm 
Customers to participate in triparty repo 
transactions through Agent Clearing 
Members on a done-with or done-away 
basis, the proposed ACS Triparty 
Service would facilitate more triparty 
repo trades being centrally cleared by 
FICC within the Agent Clearing Service. 
Increasing the volume of centrally 
cleared trades by FICC would promote

the prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of securities transactions, as 
those typically conducted outside 
central clearing would benefit from 
FICC’s risk management and settlement 
guarantees. 
Furthermore, an ACS Triparty Trade 
would be risk managed through FICC’s 
existing margin methodology and 
liquidity risk management methodology. 
Transactions are recorded in either an 
Agent Clearing Member Omnibus 
Account or Segregated Indirect 
Participant Account. When recorded in 
an Agent Clearing Member Omnibus 
Account, ACS Triparty trades would be 
netted with other Agent Clearing 
Transactions, resulting in a lower 
margin obligation.
34
Those recorded in 
Segregated Indirect Participant 
Accounts would not be netted against 
the Agent Clearing Member’s positions 
and should allow FICC to better identify 
and measure the unique risk profiles of 
those indirect participants. Therefore, 
the introduction of the ACS Triparty 
Service aligns with the directive to 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions. 
As discussed in section III.B, the 
Proposed Rule Change also aligns the 
treatment of Initial Haircuts with their 
treatment in Sponsored GC Trades. The 
change would base the Collateral Mark 
for the transaction with the Initial 
Haircut, and not the Contract Price. This 
change would ensure that the Initial 
Haircut remains with the intended party 
until final settlement. Furthermore, 
FICC specifies that Agent Clearing 
Transactions with an Initial Haircut will 
be treated as Off-The-Market 
Transactions, and that the party posting 
the Initial Haircut bears the loss of that 
haircut should FICC cease to act for the 
pre-novation counterparty. By aligning 
the treatment of Initial Haircuts in ACS 
Triparty Trades with their treatment in 
the Sponsored GC Service, FICC 
provides a consistent treatment for 
access to central clearing across both of 
their principle Indirect Participant 
triparty transaction models. This should 
ensure the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions. Furthermore, by basing the 
Collateral Mark of these transactions on 
the Initial Haircut, and not the Contract 
Price, FICC should ensure that the value 
of the Initial Haircut remains with the 
intended party, thus protecting 
investors and the public interest. 
Moreover, as described in section 
III.C, the Proposed Rule Change clarifies 
which Agent Clearing Transactions 
qualify as Same-Day Settling Trades, 
aligning treatment of the same with 
their treatment within the Sponsored 
GC Service. Additionally, as described 
in section II.B.4, FICC proposes 
technical and grammatical amendments 
throughout the Rules. Enhancing and 
clarifying the Rules ensures accuracy 
and comprehensibility for both 
Members and Indirect Participants. 
When participants have a clear 
understanding of their rights and 
obligations under the Rules, they are 
more likely to comply, thereby 
protecting investors and the public 
interest and fostering the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Proposed Rule Change is designed to 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Exchange Act. 
B. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(18)(iv)(C) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C) under the 
Act requires a covered clearing agency 
to establish, implement, maintain, and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to establish 
objective, risk-based, and publicly 
disclosed criteria for participation, 
which when the covered clearing 
agency provides central counterparty 
services for transactions in U.S. 
Treasury securities, ensure that it has 
appropriate means to facilitate access to 
clearance and settlement services of all 
eligible secondary market transactions 
in U.S. Treasury securities, including 
those of indirect participants.
35
 
As described in section III.A above, 
the Proposed Rule Change provides an 
additional avenue for Indirect 
Participants to clearance and settlement 
of done-with and done-away triparty 
repo transactions. The Commission 
understands that certain indirect 
participants who are limited in their 
ability to do so due to regulatory, 
operational, legal, size, or other 
challenges, and the creation of the ACS 
Triparty Service should allow such 
indirect participants the ability to use 
FICC to clear and settle triparty repos. 
In particular, the features of the ACS 
Triparty Service should make it easier 
for money market funds and other cash 
providers that depend on transfers of 
securities to maintain required margin, 
and typically rely on a triparty repo 
clearing bank to administer the 
collateral management to access FICC’s 
clearance and settlement services and 
for clearing members to provide such 
access.
36
Furthermore, the addition of 
the ACS Triparty Service to the Agent 
Clearing Service, as well as modeling 
the service off the existing Sponsored 
GC service, should help ensure that 
market participants are able to evaluate 
and, if they choose, use this service to 
access FICC, including for done-away 
transactions. 
Accordingly, for the reasons 
discussed above, the Commission finds 
that the Proposed Rule Change is 
consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(18)(iv)(C). 
C. Consistency With Rule 17ad–22(e)(19) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(19) requires that 
FICC establish, implement, maintain 
and enforce written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to 
identify, monitor, and manage the 
material risks to the covered clearing 
agency arising from arrangements in 
which firms that are indirect 
participants in FICC rely on the services 
provided by direct participants to access 
FICC’s clearance and settlement 
facilities.
37
The Agent Clearing Service 
allows Agent Clearing Members to 
submit to FICC for comparison, 
novation, and netting, the securities 
transactions of Executing Firm 
Customers. Executing Firm Customers 
are indirect FICC participants that rely 
on the services provided by direct FICC 
participants (i.e., Agent Clearing Members) to access FICC’s clearance 
and settlement facilities. 
As outlined above in Sections II and 
III.A, the proposed ACS Triparty Service 
would be an additional part of FICC’s 
Agent Clearing Service and leverage 
certain properties of the Sponsored GC 
Service, the two current Indirect 
Participant access models. As a result, 
FICC’s practices of requiring Agent 
Clearing Members to identify their 
Executing Firm Customers while 
providing current Legal Entity 
Identifiers (‘‘LEIs’’) for these customers 
and confirming their agent clearing 
relationships before submitting trades 
on their behalf will apply to ACS 
Triparty Trades as with other Agent 
Clearing Transactions. Additionally, 
Agent Clearing Members serve at the 
processing agent for all Executing Firm 
Customer transactions and are 
responsible for posting margin and 
satisfying any losses arising from these 
transactions. Furthermore, FICC will 
maintain its authority to request reports 
and other information from Agent 
Clearing Members, helping FICC to

See ROCIS PRA Module User Guide v.8.2, at 110–111 (Mar. 2024), available at https://
www.rocis.gov/rocis/viewResources.do (‘‘A ‘common form’ is an information collection that can 
be used by two or more agencies, or government- 
wide, for the same purpose. The Common Forms 
Module [in ROCIS] allows a ‘host’ agency to obtain 
[OMB] approval of an information collection for use 
by one or more ‘using’ agencies. After OMB grants 
approval, any prospective using agency that seeks 
to collect identical information for the same 
purpose can obtain approval to use the ‘common 
form’ by providing its agency-specific information 
to OMB (e.g., burden estimates and number of respondents).... The host agency will indicate in the Federal Register notices that it is requesting approval of a common form and, if known, identify 
other agencies that may use the information 
collection. Both the Federal Register notices and 
the ICR should account only for the burden 
imposed by the host agency’s use of the common 
form. Once the host agency has received approval 
from OMB, any agency will be able to request OMB 
approval for its use of the common form in ROCIS 
by providing its agency specific information to

agencies will not be required.’’). 
identify and monitor risks associated 
with the ACS Triparty Service. The 
proposed changes should ensure that 
Agent Clearing Members would be 
responsible for Executing Firm 
Customer transactions. 
Accordingly, for the reasons 
discussed above, the Proposed Rule 
Change is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(19).
38
 
D. Consistency With Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(21) 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(21) under the Act 
requires a CCA to establish, implement, 
maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
be efficient and effective in meeting the 
requirements of its participants and the 
markets it serves, including the clearing 
agency’s clearing and settlement 
arrangements and the scope of the 
products cleared or settled.
39
As 
described in Section II.B above, the 
current Agent Clearing Service does not 
allow Executing Firm Customers to 
transact triparty repos. The Proposed 
Rule Change seeks to expand the Agent 
Clearing Service to allow triparty repo 
trading to meet the needs of market 
participants that currently utilize 
triparty repo transactions outside of 
central clearing because they are not 
equipped to perform certain functions 
associated with such repos. By 
expanding the Agent Clearing Service to 
allow for triparty repo trading, FICC 
seeks to provide a feasible option for 
indirect participants to transact triparty 
repos in central clearing. Utilizing 
certain features present in the 
Sponsored GC Service including the 
limited Funds-Only Settlement 
Amounts and the settlement of 
securities delivery and related payment 
obligations through the ACS Triparty 
Clearing Agent Bank’s triparty repo 
platform, the Proposed Rule Change 
should facilitate access to those indirect 
participants who participate in triparty 
repo transactions. These changes should 
make it more operationally efficient for 
indirect participant parties to transact 
triparty repo transactions using FICC as 
the CCP. 
Accordingly, for the reasons 
discussed above, the Proposed Rule 
Change is consistent with Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(21). 
V. Conclusion 
On the basis of the foregoing, the 
Commission finds that the Proposed 
Rule Change is consistent with the 
requirements of the Act and, in 
particular, Section 17A(b)(3)(F), and 
Rules 17ad–22(e)(18)(iv)(C),
40
17ad– 
22(e)(19),
41
and 17ad–22(e)(21)
42
 
thereunder. 
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to 
Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act
43
 
that proposed rule change SR–FICC– 
2025–021 be, and hereby is, approved.

Notice is hereby given that, pursuant 
to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.), the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) is soliciting comments 
on the collection of information 
summarized below. The Commission 
plans to submit this existing collection 
of information to the Office of 
Management and Budget for extension 
and approval. The Commission also is 
requesting approval from OMB to 
designate this existing collection of 
information (OMB Control No. 3235– 
0305) as a ‘‘common form’’ for purposes 
of PRA submissions
1
because the Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System uses this information collection 
(under OMB Control No. 7100–0091). 
Rule 13e–1 (17 CFR 240.13e–1) under 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 
U.S.C. 78 et seq.) (‘‘Exchange Act’’) 
makes it unlawful for an issuer who has 
received notice that it is the subject of 
a tender offer made under Section 
14(d)(1) of the Exchange Act to purchase 
any of its equity securities during the 
tender offer, unless it first files a 
statement with the Commission 
containing information required by the 
rule. This rule is in keeping with the 
Commission’s statutory responsibility to 
prescribe rules and regulations that are 
necessary for the protection of investors. 
We estimate that it takes approximately 
11.25 burden hours per response to 
provide the information required under 
Rule 13e–1 and that the information is 
filed once per year by approximately 1 
respondent. We estimate that 25% of the 
11.25 hours per response is carried 
internally by the company for a total 
annual reporting burden of 
approximately 3 hours (11.25 hours per 
response × 25% × 1 response annually). We estimate that 75% of the 11.25 hours 
per response is carried externally by 
outside professionals retained by the 
company at a rate of $600 per hour for 
a total annual cost burden of 
approximately $5,063 ($600 per hour × 
11.25 hours per response × 75% × 1 response annually). 
An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to, a collection of information 
unless it displays a currently valid OMB 
control number. 
Written comments are invited on: (a) 
whether this proposed collection of 
information is necessary for the proper 
performance of the functions of the 
agency, including whether the 
information will have practical utility; 
(b) the accuracy of the agency’s estimate 
of the burden imposed by the collection 
of information; (c) ways to enhance the 
quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information collected; and (d) ways to 
minimize the burden of the collection of 
information on respondents, including 
through the use of automated collection 
techniques or other forms of information 
technology.

II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
clearing agency included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
clearing agency has prepared 
summaries, set forth in sections A, B, 
and C below, of the most significant 
aspects of such statements. 
(A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
1. Purpose 
The proposed rule change would (i) 
modify the Settlement Guide to (a) 
change how DTC sets its maximum 
debit caps for Participants, including 
Unaffiliated Participants, and Affiliated 
Families, (b) incorporate Unaffiliated 
Participants into the calculation and 
allocation of DTC’s Liquidity Fund, a 
component of the Required Participants 
Fund Deposit, and (c) make related 
definitional, technical and clarifying 
changes to the Settlement Guide; and 
(ii) modify the Rules to account for the 
Aggregate Affiliated Family Net Debit of 
an Affiliated Family, as applicable, all 
of which is described below. 
Background 
Through its settlement services, DTC 
provides book-entry transfer and pledge 
of interests in Eligible Securities and 
end-of-day net funds settlement. DTC 
maintains a liquidity structure designed 
to facilitate its maintenance of sufficient 
financial resources to complete 
settlement each Business Day 
notwithstanding the failure to settle of 
a defaulting Participant, or Affiliated 
Family of Participants, with the largest 
settlement obligation. In this effort, the 
Collateral Monitor
8
and Net Debit Cap
9
 
risk controls are employed by DTC to 
help ensure that each Delivery Versus 
Payment (‘‘DVP’’)
10
obligation of a 
Participant that is the Receiver
11
can 
satisfy its end-of-day net settlement 
obligation, if any. 
Collateral Monitor. The Collateral 
Monitor is a calculation by which DTC 
measures the sufficiency of the 
Collateral in a Participant’s account to 
cover the Participant’s net settlement 
obligation.
12
The Collateral Monitor 
prevents the completion of transactions 
that would cause a Participant’s Net 
Debit Balance
13
to exceed the value of

‘‘Collateral’’ of a Participant, as used with 
respect to its obligations to DTC, means, on any 
Business Day, the sum of (i) the Actual Participants 
Fund Deposit of the Participant, (ii) the Actual 
Preferred Stock Investment of a Participant, (iii) all 
Net Additions of the Participant, and (iv) any 
settlement progress payments (‘‘SPPs’’) wired by the 
Participant to the account of DTC at the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York in the manner specified 
in the Procedures. Rule 1, supra note 3. SPPs are funds that may be wired to DTC to increase a 
Participant’s Collateral Value for its Collateral 
Monitor and reduce a Participant’s Net Debit 
Balance. Settlement Guide, supra note 3, at 62. 15
To determine a Participant’s Net Debit Cap, 
DTC records the Participant’s three highest intraday 
net debit peaks over a rolling 70-Business Day 
period. Settlement Guide, supra note 3, at 62. The Participant’s average of these net debit peaks is 
calculated and multiplied by a factor to determine 
the Participant’s Net Debit Cap but currently not to 
exceed $2.15 BN. Id.

(December 22, 2023), 88 FR 89752 (December 28, 
2023) (SR–DTC–2023–013). The increase of $350 
MM was supported by available liquidity resources 
from the $450 MM Core Fund, to which all 
Participants contribute, and the $1.90 BN LOC, 
which is collectively $2.35 BN. Raising the 
maximum Net Debit Cap for an individual 
Participant to $2.15 BN and not to $2.35 BN 
accounts for the possibility that a defaulted 
Participant may also be a lender to the LOC (‘‘LOC 
Assumption’’). 
26
DTC assumes $1.7 BN of the LOC as available 
for liquidity purposes, with $200 MM serving as the 
LOC Assumption buffer. 
27
Prefunded liquidity from the Debt Issuance that 
is outstanding but maturing within 0–3 Business 
Days (‘‘Maturity Assumption’’) would be assumed 
to be unavailable for liquidity purposes on the Date 
of Insolvency. 
28
The Clearing Agency Liquidity Risk 
Management Framework will be amended pursuant 
to a separate proposed rule change to identify the 
proceeds from the Debt Issuance program as 
qualifying liquidity resources, in addition to the 
Participants Fund and LOC. Governance of DTC’s 
qualifying liquid resources will continue to be 
managed in accordance with the Clearing Agency 
Liquidity Risk Management Framework and related 
procedures. 
Collateral in its account.
14
In other 
words, the settlement obligation of each 
Participant must be fully collateralized, 
based on the Collateral Monitor. This is 
designed so that if a Participant fails to 
pay for its settlement obligation, DTC 
will have sufficient Collateral to obtain 
funding for settlement. 
Net Debit Caps. The Net Debit Cap of 
an individual Participant and the 
Aggregate Affiliated Family Net Debit 
Cap of an Affiliated Family 
(collectively, ‘‘Debit Caps’’) limit the 
Net Debit Balance that Participants and 
Affiliated Families can incur, 
irrespective of available Collateral. Each 
Participant’s and Affiliated Family’s 
respective Debit Cap is based on their 
specific activity level
15
and in 
consideration of DTC’s qualifying liquid 
resources (i.e., Debit Caps are set below DTC’s total available liquidity).
16
 
Together, the Debit Caps control the 
total settlement obligation that any 
Participant or Affiliated Family may 
incur. Any transaction that would cause 
a Participant or an Affiliated Family to 
exceed its respective Debit Cap will not 
be processed.
17
Instead, the transaction 
will remain in a pending status until the 
Net Debit Balance is reduced 
sufficiently to allow processing.
18
 
Setting the Debit Caps at amounts below 
DTC’s total qualifying liquid resources 
helps ensure that DTC will have 
sufficient liquidity to complete 
settlement should any single Participant 
or Affiliated Family fail to settle. 
DTC Liquidity. Currently, DTC 
maintains two key liquidity resources 
that are considered ‘‘qualifying liquid 
resources,’’ as defined by Rule 17ad– 
22(a)
19
promulgated under the Act: the 
(i) Required Participants Fund Deposits 
(‘‘Participants Fund’’), which applies 
across all Participants and equals $1.15 
BN, and (ii) a committed line of credit 
(‘‘LOC’’) of $1.9 BN. Taken together, the 
Participants Fund and LOC provide 
DTC with $3.05 BN in total qualifying 
liquid resources. 
DTC recently obtained approval to 
raise additional qualifying liquidity 
resources through the periodic issuance 
and private placement of senior notes 
(‘‘Debt Issuance’’).
20
Up to $3.0 BN in 
total can be raised from the Debt 
Issuance, as DTC deems reasonable or as 
necessitated by liquidity needs.
21
The 
proceeds from the Debt Issuance would 
supplement DTC’s existing qualifying 
liquidity resources. 
Current Net Debit Cap Amounts 
The current maximum Net Debit Cap 
for an individual Participant is $2.15 
BN,
22
while the current maximum 
Aggregate Affiliated Family Net Debit 
Cap for an Affiliated Family is $2.85 
BN,
23
both of which are below the 
current total available qualifying liquid 
resources for DTC of $3.05 BN.
24
 
The Net Debit Cap of $2.15 BN for an 
individual Participant was a recent 
change. In 2024, to reduce transaction 
blockage and the need to make SPPs, 
DTC increased the individual 
Participant Net Debit Cap from $1.8 BN 
to $2.15 BN.
25
Since the 
implementation of this increase, 
Participants have urged DTC to reassess 
the current maximum Debit Cap levels, 
for both individual Participants and 
Affiliated Families, given increasing 
transaction volumes. Increased 
transaction volumes can result in 
Participants incurring higher intraday 
net debit peaks, which then increase the 
likelihood that the Participants will 
reach DTC’s maximum Net Debit Cap. If, 
though, DTC had a greater maximum 
Debit Cap, then it would reduce the 
need for Participants to make SPPs to 
reduce their net debits. 
Having reviewed transaction volumes, 
pending activity, and SPPs, as discussed 
below, DTC agrees that there is a need 
to further increase the Debit Caps and 
that there also is an opportunity to do 
so given the recent expansion of DTC’s 
qualifying liquid resources to include 
proceeds from a Debt Issuance. DTC 
believes that further increases to the 
maximum Debit Caps would further 
reduce activity blockage and the need 
for Participants to submit SPPs, as 
described below. 
Proposed Change to the Net Debit Cap 
and Aggregate Affiliated Family Net 
Debit Cap 
DTC proposes to change the 
maximum Debit Caps for Participants 
and Affiliated Families from the current 
fixed amounts of $2.15 BN and $2.85 
BN, respectively, to a flexible amount 
not to exceed the amount of available 
qualifying liquid resources at DTC. 
As explained above, DTC’s liquidity 
resources are a $1.15 BN Participants 
Fund, a $1.9 BN LOC,
26
and the 
proceeds from any issuance of senior 
notes through the Debt Issuance 
program.
27
The Debt Issuance program 
would provide additional liquidity 
resources to allow DTC the flexibility to 
increase the maximum Debit Caps. DTC 
would manage the caps based on its 
total liquidity resources, related costs, 
and the projected benefit to Participants, 
including reduced transaction blockage 
and the need to submit SPPs to reduce 
a net debit balance.
28
 
By allowing for a flexible maximum 
Debit Cap, the proposed rule change 
would provide for transaction 
processing efficiencies that would lower 
the likelihood of transactions pending 
under a cap limit or a Receiving 
Participant needing to submit SPPs to 
reduce its intraday Net Debit Balance to 
allow a transaction to process. 
Moreover, any Participant that is a 
Deliverer in a DVP transaction may 
realize processing efficiencies when the

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61207 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices 29
DTC will continue to maintain and does not 
propose to change its current authority to lower an 
individual Participant’s maximum Net Debit Cap. 
See Rule 1, supra note 3. 30
Rule 1, supra note 3. 31
Settlement Guide, supra note 3, at 45–47. The Core Fund is set by DTC at an aggregate amount of 
$450 MM and is comprised of the Base Fund and 
the Incremental Fund. The Base Fund is the sum 
of all minimum deposits by all Participants (i.e., 
$7,500 times the number of Participants at any 
time). Id. The Incremental Fund is the balance of the Core Fund up to $450 MM, which is ratably 
allocated among Participants that are required to 
pay more than a minimum deposit. Id. The second main component is the Liquidity Fund, which is set 
at $700 MM and applies to Participants whose 
Affiliated Families have Affiliated Family Net Debit 
Caps that exceed $2.15 BN. Id. 
Receiver maintains a higher Debit Cap, 
as the transaction would not pend. 
Maintaining a flexible maximum 
Debit Cap would benefit Participants. A 
Net Debit increase impact study 
(‘‘Impact Study’’) conducted by DTC for 
the period June 2, 2024, through January 
31, 2025, showed that out of 179 
Participant families, 17 (across 44 
Accounts) would likely realize an 
immediate benefit from a Debit Cap 
increase. The liquidity needs across 
legal entities were determined by 
looking at families reaching 90 percent 
of the current $2.85 BN cap limit, and 
by identifying the transactions pending 
under cap limits and any incoming 
SPPs. An increase in the maximum cap 
by $0.75 BN to $1 BN would lead to a 
reduction of $3.62 BN to $4.43 BN in 
daily SPPs sent across the 17 families 
benefiting from the proposed change. 
In the event DTC determined to adjust 
the Debit Caps downward, due to 
anticipation of a reduction in available 
liquidity resources or otherwise, DTC 
would provide Participants with a 
minimum of 10 Business Days’ notice 
via Important Notice, in order to allow 
Participants to adjust their own 
liquidity management strategies, as 
needed.
29
 
Expansion of Participants Eligible for 
Liquidity Fund 
As noted above, the Liquidity Fund 
component (set at $700 MM) of the 
Participants Fund applies to 
Participants whose Affiliated Families 
have Debit Caps that exceed $2.15 BN. 
Because an Unaffiliated Participant 
cannot currently have a Debit Cap that 
exceeds $2.15 BN, such Participants are 
not subject to a Liquidity Fund 
allocation. 
Given that the maximum Debit Cap 
for an Unaffiliated Participant could 
exceed $2.15 BN under this proposal, 
thus relying in part on the Liquidity 
Fund to support the increase cap 
amount, DTC proposes to expand the 
allocation of the Liquidity Fund 
contribution to Unaffiliated Participants 
that have Debit Caps that exceed $2.15 
BN. 
The Impact Study conducted by DTC 
showed that with this proposed change, 
two Unaffiliated Participants now 
would be subject to the Liquidity Fund. 
The number of Affiliated Families, and 
Unaffiliated Participants paying into the 
Liquidity Fund (those whose Debit Caps 
would exceed $2.15 BN) is estimated to 
increase from 18 to 21, with an average 
daily contribution of $33.3 MM per 
family, ranging between $39.1 MM to 
$1.6 MM. However, given the increase 
in the number of Participants 
contributing to the Liquidity Fund 
overall, the highest amount paid by a 
single family is estimated to go down to 
$39.1 MM from $50.5 MM. 
Proposed Rule Changes 
Settlement Guide Changes. To 
effectuate the proposed changes, several 
updates would be made to the 
Settlement Guide. First, the Important 
Terms section of the guide would be 
updated to include definitions for 
Affiliated Family and Unaffiliated 
Participant. The proposed definition for 
Affiliated Family would match the 
definition already used in the Rules.
30
 
Specifically, the definition would read, 
‘‘[a]n Affiliated Family means each 
Participant that controls or is controlled 
by another Participant and each 
Participant that is under the common 
control of any Person. For purposes of 
this definition, ‘‘control’’ means the 
direct or indirect ownership of more 
than 50 percent of the voting securities 
or other voting interests of any Person.’’ 
Meanwhile, Unaffiliated Participant 
would be defined to mean, ‘‘[a] 
Participant that is not included in an 
Affiliated Family.’’ A technical change 
also would be made in the Important 
Terms section to refer to the Collateral 
Monitor as a ‘‘calculation’’ rather than a 
‘‘process’’ for consistency with the 
Rules, which set forth a methodology for 
calculation of the Collateral Monitor. 
Second, the Amounts subsection of 
the Participants Fund and Preferred 
Stock Investment section of the 
Settlement Guide would be updated to 
more clearly describe the components of 
the Participants Fund. Although the 
Settlement Guide accurately describes 
the aggregate Participants Fund as 
including four components (i.e., the Core Fund, Base Fund, Incremental 
Fund, and Liquidity Fund), two of these 
are considered the main component 
amounts: the Core Fund and the 
Liquidity Fund.
31
This proposal would 
update the Settlement Guide to describe 
the aggregate Participants Fund more 
simply as the Core Fund and the 
Liquidity Fund, where the Core Fund is 
made up of the Base Fund and the 
Incremental Fund. More importantly, 
the Amounts subsection would be 
revised to no longer consider the 
Liquidity Fund as applicable only to 
Affiliated Families that have Net Debit 
Caps that exceed $2.15 BN. Instead, the 
subsection would read that the 
Liquidity Fund applies to certain 
Unaffiliated Participants and Affiliated 
Families, as would be described in the 
updated Liquidity Fund subsection. 
Third, the steps explaining the 
Liquidity Fund allocation formula in the 
Liquidity Fund subsection of the How 
the Required Deposit to the Participants 
Fund and the Required Preferred Stock 
Investment are Calculated for a 
Participant section of the Settlement 
Guide would be simplified, clarified, 
and adjusted to account for the 
proposed changes described above, in 
particular, the inclusion of Unaffiliated 
Participants in the calculation. 
The subsection would begin by 
explaining that the Liquidity Fund 
would be proportionally shared among 
both Unaffiliated Participants and 
Participants of Affiliated Families that 
have Net Debit Caps that exceed $2.15 
BN, thus removing language that limited 
the Liquidity Fund to only Affiliated 
Families. The steps for calculating that 
allocation would then be updated to 
reflect that change, so that Unaffiliated 
Participants would be part of the 
calculation. More specifically, 
Unaffiliated Participants would be 
added to the ‘‘Overage’’ calculation, 
which is the amount that an Affiliated 
Family’s and now an Unaffiliated 
Participant’s Net Debit Cap exceeds 
$2.15 BN up to $2.85 BN. Next, the 
calculation of the allocation percentage 
would be updated to include 
Unaffiliated Participants and then that 
percentage would be used to calculate 
the allocation amounts of Unaffiliated 
Participants too. 
In addition to several clarification, 
grammatical, and organizational updates 
to the entire Liquidity Fund subsection 
for readability and simplicity, the 
subsection would conclude by stating 
that Unaffiliated Participants would not 
be part of calculation that determines 
the proportion of the Liquidity Fund 
allocation amount among Participants of 
Affiliated Families since Unaffiliated 
Participants are not part of an Affiliated 
Family. Rather, their proportion is 
simply their allocation amount. 
Fourth, to maintain alignment of the 
Net Debit Cap with qualifying liquid 
resources, as described above, the 
Settlement Guide would further provide 
in the Net Debit Cap section that the

‘‘Instructor’’ means a Participant or Pledgee 
which gives DTC an instruction with respect to (i) 
a Delivery, Pledge, Release or Withdrawal of 
Securities, (ii) a payment in connection with a 
transaction in Securities or (iii) any other 
instruction pursuant to these Rules and the 
Procedures. Rule 1, supra note 3. 33
‘‘Contra Party’’ means an Account in the 
Account Family of another Participant or Pledgee 
(other than the Instructor) or an Account in the 
same or another Account Family of the Instructor. 
Rule 9(B), supra note 3. For clarity, the term ‘‘Account Family’’ refers to an Account or group of 
Accounts designated as such by a Participant, using 
a common set of risk management controls. Rule 1, 
supra note 3. It does not mean accounts of an Affiliated Family.

35

36
Id. 
Debit Caps would always be set lower 
than DTC’s total available liquidity 
resources, may never exceed DTC’s 
maximum Net Debit Cap, and would be 
determined based on benefits to 
Participants, DTC’s total available 
liquidity resources and related costs. It 
also would be noted that governance of 
DTC’s liquidity and liquidity resources 
would continue to be in accordance 
with the Clearing Agency Liquidity Risk 
Management Framework and related 
procedures. Finally, the section would 
make clear that the Aggregate Affiliated 
Family Net Debit Cap of an Affiliated 
Family may be shared among the 
Participants of the Affiliated Family 
according to either (i) the proportional 
liquidity usage of the Participants as 
calculated by DTC’s system or (ii) as 
DTC is instructed, in writing, by the 
Affiliated Family. 
Lastly, the Calculation of Participant 
Net Debit Caps section of the Settlement 
Guide would be updated to (i) replace 
a reference to $2.15 BN being the 
maximum Participant Net Debit Cap 
with a general reference to the Net Debit 
Cap, since it would no longer be a fixed 
number, and (ii) provide for the 
minimum 10 Business Day notice that 
DTC would issue by Important Notice to 
Participants for any decrease in the 
maximum Debit Cap, including 
outreach to affected Participants. 
Rules Changes. DTC would make 
technical and clarifying changes to the 
Rules for consistency with the 
description of the function of the 
Aggregate Affiliated Family Net Debit 
Cap in the Settlement Guide. 
Specifically, Rule 9(B) (Transactions in 
Eligible Securities), which includes a 
description of the operation of the 
Collateral Monitor and Net Debit Cap 
would be updated to reflect that a 
transaction would not be processed if it 
would cause a Participant that is a 
member of an Affiliated Family to 
exceed the Aggregate Affiliated Family 
Net Debit Cap of the Affiliated Family, 
regardless of whether the Participant is 
the Instructor
32
or a Contra Party.
33
 
Relatedly, to describe the sum of the Net 
Debit Balances of an Affiliated Family of 
Participants for use in the proposed 
description in Rule 9(B) of the function 
of Aggregate Affiliated Family Net Debit 
Cap, a new term, ‘‘Aggregate Affiliated 
Family Net Debit,’’ would be added to 
Rule 1 (Definitions; Governing Law) and 
defined as ‘‘the amount by which the 
algebraic sum of all money debits and 
charges to the Accounts of an Affiliated 
Family exceeds the sum of all money 
credits thereto.’’ 
Implementation Timeline 
DTC would implement the proposed 
rule changes upon approval by the 
Commission; however, the actual 
maximum Debit Cap amount for DTC 
would not increase until DTC secured 
additional qualifying liquid resources, 
such as with the Debit Issuance 
described above. 
2. Statutory Basis 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
34
of the Act 
requires that the rules of the clearing 
agency be designed, inter alia, to 
promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of securities 
transactions. DTC believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act and the 
rules promulgated thereunder, 
particularly Rule 17ad–22(e)(7)(i).
35
 
The Impact Study indicates that by 
allowing for a flexible maximum Debit 
Cap that can be increased, as described 
above, the proposed rule change would 
help improve transaction processing by 
enabling more transactions to process 
without the need for a Receiving 
Participant to wait for DVP-related 
credits or submit SPPs to reduce its 
intraday Net Debit Balance. Moreover, 
any Participant that is a Deliverer of a 
DVP may see less of its deliveries pend 
because the Receiver may maintain a 
higher Debit Cap. Meanwhile, the 
proposed adjustable Debit Cap would 
continue to be supported by adequate 
DTC liquidity resources available to 
complete system-wide settlement in the 
event of a failure to settle by the largest 
Participant or Affiliated Family. By 
improving transaction processing within 
DTC’s liquidity resources, as well as the 
readability and clarity of the Settlement 
Guide and Rules related to the proposed 
changes, DTC believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, cited above, by 
helping to promote the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
securities transactions. 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(7)(i) promulgated 
under the Act requires, inter alia, that 
DTC, a covered clearing agency, 
establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to, as applicable, 
effectively measure, monitor, and 
manage the liquidity risk that arises in 
or is borne by the covered clearing 
agency, including measuring, 
monitoring, and managing its settlement 
and funding flows on an ongoing and 
timely basis, and its use of intraday 
liquidity by, at a minimum, maintaining 
sufficient liquid resources to effect 
same-day settlement of payment 
obligations with a high degree of 
confidence under a wide range of 
foreseeable stress scenarios that 
includes, but is not limited to, the 
default of the participant family that 
would generate the largest aggregate 
payment obligation for the covered 
clearing agency in extreme but plausible 
market conditions
36
(i.e., the ‘‘Cover One standard’’). 
DTC’s liquidity needs are driven by 
its need to protect against a Participant 
failing to pay its settlement obligations. 
The tools available to DTC, including 
the above described Debit Caps, allow it 
to regularly test the sufficiency of its 
liquid resources on an intraday and end- 
of-day basis and adjust to stressed 
circumstances during a settlement day 
to protect itself and Participants against 
liquidity exposure under normal and 
stressed market conditions. DTC 
calculates its liquidity needs per 
Participant (at a legal entity level) and 
further aggregates these amounts at a 
family level (that is, including all 
affiliated Participants, based on the 
assumption that all such affiliates may 
fail simultaneously). In this regard, DTC 
monitors settlement flows and net-debit 
obligations daily, and its current 
available liquidity resources are 
sufficient to satisfy the Cover One 
standard. 
As described above, the proposed rule 
change would only permit an increase 
to the maximum Debit Caps to an 
amount below DTC’s total available 
liquidity, which is currently made up of 
the Participants Fund, LOC, and any 
Debt Issuance, and it would not 
otherwise alter the way DTC monitors 
settlement flows and net-debit 
obligations. Also, the proposed rule 
change would require Unaffiliated 
Participants to contribute to the 
Liquidity Fund to cover exposures 
relating to their use of liquidity above 
$2.15 BN, ensuring that all Participants 
contribute to DTC’s liquidity resources 
in a proportionate manner. Moreover,

decreasing Debit Caps, including 
specific outreach to affected 
Participants. Therefore, DTC believes 
the proposal is consistent with Rule 
17ad–22(e)(7)(i), cited above, because 
the proposed increase would remain 
aligned with DTC’s continued 
maintenance of sufficient liquid 
resources to satisfy its Cover One 
standard and not change DTC’s 
monitoring of settlement flows and net- 
debit obligations. 
(B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
DTC does not believe that the 
proposed rule change would impose a 
burden on competition.
37
The proposed 
rule change would simply allow DTC to 
maintain a flexible maximum Debt Cap, 
with a ceiling less than the total amount 
of DTC’s available liquidity resources, 
as described above. The flexibility of the 
Debit Cap would apply to each 
Participant, including Unaffiliated 
Participants and Affiliated Families 
equally, as applicable. 
Also, the proposed rule change 
provides that Unaffiliated Participants 
that utilize liquidity in an amount above 
$2.15 BN would be obligated to 
contribute to the Liquidity Fund in the 
same way as an Affiliated Family does 
today. That is, the obligation only 
would apply to Unaffiliated Participants 
whose activity results in needing 
liquidity in excess of $2.15 BN and 
would be directly proportional to the 
Unaffiliated Participant’s activity, as 
determined by the algorithms used to 
calculate allocations under the Liquidity 
Fund, as is done for Affiliated Families 
today. At the same time, it would be less 
likely that the Unaffiliated Participant’s 
activity would pend or that it would 
need to submit SPPs since it would have 
a greater Debit Cap. Nevertheless, if an 
Unaffiliated Participant did not want to 
contribute to the Liquidity Fund, 
despite the benefits, then it could 
simply manage its activity to stay below 
the $2.15 BN liquidity threshold. 
Therefore, DTC does not believe this 
proposed change would impose a 
burden on competition. 
DTC believes the proposed rule 
change may promote competition 
because it alleviates the need for some 
Participants to wait for DVP credits or 
submit SPPs for their transactions to 
process. Moreover, any Participant that 
is a Deliverer in a DVP transaction may 
realize processing efficiencies when the 
Receiver maintains a higher Debit Cap, 
as the transaction may not pend due to 
the higher maximum. 
(C) Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Comments on the Proposed Rule 
Change Received From Members, 
Participants, or Others 
DTC has not received or solicited any 
written comments relating to this 
proposal. If any written comments are

To further distinguish current Rule 8.201 from 
proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) and promote clarity 
in Exchange rules, the Exchange proposes to add a 
parenthetical to the title of Rule 8.201 to designate 
it as applicable to non-generically listed series of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares. The Exchange also 
proposes non-substantive, conforming changes 
throughout current Rule 8.201 to add references to 
its new title, Rule 8.201 (Non-Generic), to ensure 
specificity and transparency in the rule text. The 
Exchange proposes to retain Rule 8.201 (Non- 
Generic) to accommodate any existing products 
listed and traded under such rule that may not meet 
the requirements of proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic), 
as well as to promote consistency between the rules 
of the Exchange and its affiliated equities 
exchanges. The Exchange also proposes to amend 
current Rule 8.201(c)(2), which defines the term 
‘‘commodity,’’ to ensure that the rule refers to the 
correct section of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
5
Rule 19b–4(e)(1) provides that the listing and 
trading of a new derivative securities product by a 
self-regulatory organization (‘‘SRO’’) is not deemed 
a proposed rule change, pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(1) of Rule 19b–4, if the Commission has 
approved, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, the 
SRO’s trading rules, procedures and listing 
standards for the product class that would include 
the new derivative securities product and the SRO 
has a surveillance program for the product class. As 
contemplated by proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic), the 
Exchange proposes to establish generic listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
meet the criteria of the rule. Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares listed under proposed Rule 8.201 
(Generic) would therefore not need a separate 
proposed rule change pursuant to Rule 19b–4 before 
they could be listed and traded on the Exchange. 
Rule 19b-4(e) requires an SRO seeking to rely on 
Rule 19b–4(e) to file Form 19b–4(e) with the 
Commission within 5 business days after 
commencement of trading a new derivative 
securities product that is not deemed to be a 
proposed rule change. 
have been prepared by the self- 
regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes new Rule 
8.201 (Generic) to permit the generic 
listing and trading of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares that meet the requirements 
of such rule. The proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
www.nyse.com, at the principal office of the Exchange, and at the Commission’s 
Public Reference Room. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of, 
and basis for, the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of those statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The Exchange has prepared summaries, 
set forth in sections A, B, and C below, 
of the most significant parts of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes new Rule 
8.201 (Generic), which would permit 
the generic listing and trading of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
meet the requirements of the Rule. 
Current Rule 8.201 would continue to 
provide for the listing and trading of 
series of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
for which the Exchange would file 
separate proposals under Section 19(b) 
of the Act.
4
Consistent with other 
products that may currently list on the 
Exchange pursuant to generic listing 
standards (e.g., Investment Company Units listed pursuant to Rule 5.2(j)(3), 
Managed Fund Shares listed pursuant to 
Rule 8.600, and ETF Shares listed 
pursuant to Rule 5.2(j)(8)), the Exchange 
proposes that Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares that meet the requirements of 
proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) would be 
permitted to be listed and traded on the 
Exchange without prior Commission 
approval order or notice of effectiveness 
pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.
5
 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed generic listing standards for 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares would 
facilitate the efficient listing of such 
products by significantly reducing the 
time frame and costs associated with 
bringing these securities to market, 
which would in turn promote market 
competition among issuers of such 
products, to the benefit of the investing 
public. 
As further discussed below, proposed 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) is based on Rule 
8.201–E (Generic) of the Exchange’s 
affiliated exchange, NYSE Arca, Inc. 
(‘‘NYSE Arca’’), with only the following 
non-substantive conforming changes: 
€Replacement of references to ‘‘ETP Holder’’ with references to ‘‘member 
organization’’; and 
€Replacement of internal references to NYSE Arca rules with references to 
NYSE rules (e.g., Rule 7.34 rather than Rule 7.34–E). 
Proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
Proposed Rule 8.201(a) (Generic) 
would provide that the Exchange will 
consider for trading, whether by listing 
or pursuant to unlisted trading 
privileges, Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares that meet the criteria of this Rule 
and that the Exchange may list and/or 
trade Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
that meet the standards set forth in this 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) pursuant to Rule 
19b–4(e) under the Exchange Act. If a 
series of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
listed pursuant to proposed Rule 8.201 
(Generic) does not satisfy these 
requirements, the Exchange may 
suspend trading in the shares and will 
initiate delisting proceedings pursuant 
to Rule 5.5(m). Proposed Rule 8.201(a) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(a) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(b) (Generic) 
would provide that Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
is applicable only to Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares listed pursuant to this 
Rule. Except to the extent inconsistent 
with this Rule, or unless the context 
otherwise requires, the provisions of the 
Bylaws and all other rules and 
procedures of the Board of Directors 
shall be applicable to the trading on the 
Exchange of such securities. 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares are 
included within the definition of 
‘‘security’’ or ‘‘securities’’ as such terms 
are used in the Bvlaws and Rules of the 
Exchange and are subject to the 
Exchange’s existing rules governing the 
trading of equity securities. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(b) (Generic) is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(b) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c) (Generic) 
would set forth definitions for purposes 
of Rule 8.201 (Generic). Proposed Rule 
8.201(c)(1) (Generic), which is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(1) (Generic), 
would define Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares for purposes of Rule 8.201 
(Generic) as a security that: 
€Is issued by a trust, limited liability company, partnership, or other similar 
entity (‘‘Trust’’) that, if applicable, is 
operated by a registered commodity 
pool operator pursuant to the 
Commodity Exchange Act, and is not 
registered as an investment company 
pursuant to the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, or series or class thereof 
(proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(i) (Generic)); 
€Is designed to reflect the performance of one or more reference 
assets or an index of reference assets, 
less expenses and other liabilities 
(proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(ii) (Generic)); 
€In order to reflect the performance as provided in (c)(1)(ii) above, is issued 
by a Trust that holds (A) one or more 
commodities or commodity-based assets 
as defined in (c)(3) below, and (B) in 
addition to such commodities or 
commodity-based assets, may hold 
securities, cash, and cash equivalents 
(proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(iii) 
(Generic));

i.e., such futures contract has been listed and traded on a designated contract market for at least 
six months. 
€Is issued by a Trust in a specified aggregate minimum number in return 
for a deposit of (A) a specified quantity 
of the underlying commodities, 
commodity-based assets, securities, 
cash, and cash equivalents or (B) a cash 
amount with a value based on the next 
determined net asset value per Trust 
share (proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(iv) 
(Generic)); and 
€When aggregated in the same specified minimum number, may be 
redeemed at a holder’s request by a 
Trust which will deliver to the 
redeeming holder (A) the specified 
quantity of the-underlying commodities, 
commodity-based assets, securities, 
cash, and cash equivalents or (B) a cash 
amount with a value based on the next 
determined net asset value per Trust 
share (proposed Rule 8.201(c)(1)(v) 
(Generic)). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(2) (Generic) 
would define the term ‘‘commodity’’ to 
have the same meaning as set forth in 
Section 1a(9) of the Commodity 
Exchange Act and to exclude ‘‘excluded 
commodity’’ as defined in Section 
1a(19) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(3) (Generic) 
would define the term ‘‘commodity- 
based asset’’ to mean a future, option, or 
swap on a commodity as defined in 
proposed Rule 8.201(c)(2) above. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(3) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(3) 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(4) (Generic), 
which is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(c)(4) (Generic), would define 
the term ‘‘cash equivalent.’’ The 
Exchange proposes that ‘‘cash 
equivalents’’ would refer to short-term 
instruments with maturities of less than 
three months and include the following, 
as defined in proposed Rules 
8.201(c)(4)(i) (Generic) through (vii) 
(Generic): 
€U.S. Government securities, including bills, notes, and bonds 
differing as to maturity and rate of 
interest, which are either issued or 
guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by 
U.S. Government agencies or 
instrumentalities; 
€Certificates of deposit issued against funds deposited in a bank or 
savings and loan association; 
€Bankers’ acceptances, which are short-term credit instruments used to 
finance commercial transactions; 
€Repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements; 
€Bank time deposits, which are monies kept on deposit with banks or 
savings and loan associations for a 
stated period of time at a fixed rate of 
interest; 
€Commercial paper, which are short- term unsecured promissory notes; and 
€Money market funds. Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(5) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘net asset value’’ as an 
amount reflecting the current market 
value of the assets held by the Trust, 
less expenses and liabilities, used to 
periodically compute the current price 
for the purpose of creation and 
redemption of Trust shares. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(c)(5) (Generic) is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(5) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(6) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘designated contract 
market’’ as a board of trade or exchange 
that has been designated as a contract 
market under Section 5 of the 
Commodity Exchange Act and operates 
under the regulatory oversight of the 
Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, pursuant to Section 5 of 
the Commodity Exchange Act. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(c)(6) (Generic) is based on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(6) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(7) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘exchange-traded fund’’ 
as an open-end management investment 
company or a unit investment trust as 
defined in Section 4(2) of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 or 
series or class thereof, the shares of 
which are listed and traded on a 
national securities exchange, and that 
has formed and operates under an 
exemptive order under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 or in reliance on 
an exemptive rule adopted by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(7) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(7) 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(8) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘indicative trust value’’ as 
the estimated indicative value of a Trust 
share based on current information 
regarding the value of the Trust’s 
underlying assets. Proposed Rule 
8.201(c)(8) (Generic) is based on NYSE 
Arca Rule 8.201–E(c)(8) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(9) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘market price’’ as the 
official closing price of a Trust share or, 
if it more accurately reflects the market 
value of a Trust share at the time as of 
which the Trust calculates current net 
asset value per share, the price that is 
the midpoint between the national best 
bid and national best offer as of that 
time. Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(9) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(c)(9) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(10) (Generic) 
would define ‘‘premium or discount’’ as 
the positive or negative difference 
between the market price of a Trust 
share at the time as of which the current 
net asset value is calculated and the 
Trust’s current net asset value per share, 
expressed as a percentage of the Trust 
share’s current net asset value per share. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(c)(10) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201– 
E(c)(10) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(d) (Generic) 
would set forth the eligibility criteria for 
the holdings of Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares listed pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic). Proposed Rule 8.201(d)(1) 
(Generic), which is based on NYSE Arca 
Rule 8.201–E(d)(1) (Generic) with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic), would provide for the 
following criteria, at least one of which 
must be met for each commodity or 
commodity that underlies a commodity- 
based asset held by a Trust: 
€On an initial and continuing basis, the commodity trades on a market that 
is an Intermarket Surveillance Group 
(‘‘ISG’’) member, provided that the 
Exchange may obtain information about 
trading in such commodity from the ISG 
member (proposed Rule 8.201(d)(1)(i) 
(Generic)); 
€On an initial and continuing basis, the commodity underlies a futures 
contract that has been made available to 
trade on a designated contract market 
for at least six months;
6
provided that 
the Exchange has a comprehensive 
surveillance sharing agreement, whether 
directly or through common 
membership in ISG, with such 
designated contract market (proposed 
Rule 8.201(d)(1)(ii) (Generic)); or 
€On an initial basis, an exchange- traded fund designed to provide 
economic exposure of no less than 40% 
of its net asset value to the commodity 
lists and trades on a national securities 
exchange (proposed Rule 8.201(d)(1)(iii) 
(Generic)). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(d)(2) (Generic) 
would provide that, on an initial and 
continuing basis, each security held by 
the Trust shall meet the criteria of Rule 
8.600 (Managed Fund Shares), 
Commentary .01(a) and (b) or, if the 
security is a listed option, trades on an 
ISG market. Proposed Rule 8.201(d)(2) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(d)(2) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.600 
instead of Rule 8.600–E. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(e) (Generic), 
which is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(e) (Generic), would set forth the 
information that the Trust must disclose 
prominently on its website, which must 
be publicly available free of charge:

The Exchange notes that proposed Rule 8.201(g)

€The Trust share’s median-ask spread, expressed as a percentage 
rounded to the nearest hundredth, 
computed by: (i) identifying the Trust 
share’s national best bid and national 
best offer as of the end of each 10 
second interval during each trading day 
of the last 30 calendar days; (ii) dividing 
the difference between each such bid 
and offer by the midpoint of the 
national best bid and national best offer; 
and (iii) identifying the median of those 
values (proposed Rule 8.201(e)(5) 
(Generic)); 
€Liquidity risk policies and procedures as described in paragraph (g) 
of proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
(proposed Rule 8.201(e)(6) (Generic)); 
€The Trust’s methodology for the calculation of its net asset value 
(proposed Rule 8.201(e)(7) (Generic)); 
€The Trust’s trading volume for the previous day (proposed Rule 8.201(e)(8) 
(Generic)); and 
€The Trust’s effective prospectus, in a form available for download (proposed 
Rule 8.201(e)(9) (Generic)). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(f) (Generic) 
would provide that the Trust may not 
seek, directly or indirectly, to provide 
investment returns that correspond to 
the performance of an index, 
benchmark, or reference value by a 
specified multiple, or to provide 
investment returns that have an inverse 
or multiple inverse relationship to the 
performance of an index, benchmark, or 
reference value, over a predetermined 
period of time. Proposed Rule 8.201(f) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(f) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(g) (Generic), 
which is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(g) (Generic), would provide 
that, if a Trust has on a daily basis less 
than 85% of its assets readily available 
to meet redemption requests, the Trust 
must have written liquidity risk policies 
and procedures that are reasonably 
designed to address the risk that it could 
not meet requests to redeem shares 
issued by the Trust without significant 
dilution of remaining shareholders’ 
interest in the Trust.
7
For purposes of 
this Rule, an asset is deemed not readily 
available to meet redemption requests if 
it is segregated, pledged, hypothecated, 
encumbered, or otherwise restricted or 
prevented from being liquidated, sold, 
transferred, or assigned within one 
business day. Rule 8.201(g) (Generic) 
would further provide that the Trust’s 
liquidity risk policies and procedures 
will be periodically reviewed by the 
Trust (at least annually) and address the 
following criteria, as applicable: 
€The Trust’s investment strategy and liquidity of the Trust’s assets during 
normal and stressed conditions, 
including holdings in derivatives and 
whether the investment strategy is 
appropriate for effective and efficient 
arbitrage (proposed Rule 8.201(g)(1) 
(Generic)); 
€Holdings of cash and cash equivalents, as well as borrowing 
arrangements and other funding sources 
(proposed Rule 8.201(g)(2) (Generic)); 
and 
€Percentage and description of the Trust’s assets that are segregated, 
pledged, hypothecated, encumbered, or 
otherwise restricted or prevented from 
being liquidated, sold, transferred or 
assigned (proposed Rule 8.201(g)(3) 
(Generic)).

Proposed Rule 8.201(h) (Generic) 
would provide that Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares may be listed and traded 
on the Exchange pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) provided that, upon initial 
listing, the Exchange will establish a 
minimum number of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares required to be outstanding 
at the time of commencement of trading 
on the Exchange, and all Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares shall have a stated 
investment objective, which shall be 
adhered to under normal market 
conditions. Proposed Rule 8.201(h) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(h) (Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(i) (Generic) 
would provide for continued listing 
standards for Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares listed pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic). Proposed Rule 8.201(i) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(i) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change in proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(9) to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). The Exchange will maintain 
surveillance procedures for Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares listed under Rule 
8.201 (Generic) and will consider the 
suspension of trading in and the 
delisting of such Trust shares under any 
of the following circumstances: 
€If, following the initial twelve- month period following commencement 
of trading on the Exchange of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, the 
Trust has more than 60 days remaining 
until termination and there are fewer 
than 50 record and/or beneficial holders 
of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(1) (Generic)); or 
€If, following the initial twelve- month period following commencement 
of trading on the Exchange of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, the 
Trust has fewer than 50,000 shares 
issued and outstanding (proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(2) (Generic)); or 
€If, following the initial twelve- month period following commencement 
of trading on the Exchange of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares, the 
market value of all shares issued and 
outstanding is less than $1,000,000 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(3) (Generic)); or 
€If the value of the underlying reference asset(s) or index is no longer 
calculated or made widely available on 
at least a 15-second basis from a source 
unaffiliated with the sponsor or the 
Trust (proposed Rule 8.201(i)(4) 
(Generic)); 
€If the Indicative Trust Value is no longer calculated or made widely 
available to all market participants at 
the same time on at least a 15-second 
basis during the Core Trading Session 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(5) (Generic)); 
€If the net asset value is not calculated at least once daily or made 
widely available to all market 
participants at the same time (proposed 
Rule 8.201(i)(6) (Generic)); 
€If the information as set forth in this Rule 8.201 is no longer being disclosed

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61213 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices in accordance with the requirement of 
paragraph (e) above (proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(7) (Generic)); 
€If any of the other continued listing requirements set forth in this Rule are 
not continuously maintained (proposed 
Rule 8.201(i)(8) (Generic)); 
€If the Exchange submits a rule filing pursuant to Section 19(b) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to 
permit the listing and trading of a series 
of Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
do not otherwise meet the standards set 
forth in this Rule and any of the 
statements or representations regarding 
(a) the description of the index, 
portfolio, or reference asset, (b) 
limitations on the index, portfolio 
holdings, or reference assets, or (c) the 
applicability of Exchange listing rules 
specified in such rule filing are not 
continuously maintained; or if such 
other event shall occur or condition 
exists which in the opinion of the 
Exchange makes further dealings on the 
Exchange inadvisable (proposed Rule 
8.201(i)(9) (Generic)); 
€Upon termination of a Trust, the Exchange requires that Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares issued in connection 
with such Trust be removed from 
Exchange listing. A Trust may terminate 
in accordance with the provisions of the 
Trust prospectus, which may provide 
for termination if the value of the Trust 
falls below a specified amount 
(proposed Rule 8.201(i)(10) (Generic)). 
Rule 8.201(j) (Generic) would set forth 
requirements applicable to Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares issued by an entity 
structured as a trust, on an initial and 
continuing basis. Proposed Rule 
8.201(j)(1) (Generic) would require that 
the stated term of the trust be as stated 
in the trust prospectus, provided that a 
trust may be terminated under such 
earlier circumstances as may be 
specified in the trust prospectus. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(j)(2) (Generic) 
would set forth requirements that apply 
to the trustee of a trust. Proposed Rule 
8.201(j)(2)(i) (Generic) would require 
that the trustee of a trust must be a trust 
company or banking institution having 
substantial capital and surplus and the 
experience and facilities for handling 
corporate trust business and that, if an 
individual has been appointed as 
trustee, a qualified trust company or 
banking institution must be appointed 
co-trustee. Proposed Rule 8.201(j)(2)(ii) 
(Generic) would provide that no change 
is to be made in the trustee of a listed 
issue without prior notice to and 
approval of the Exchange. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(j)(3) (Generic) would provide 
that voting rights will be as set forth in 
the applicable trust prospectus. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(j) (Generic) and the 
subparagraphs thereunder are based on 
current Rule 8.201(e)(3) through (5) 
without any substantive changes, as 
well as on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(j) 
(Generic). 
Rule 8.201(k) (Generic) would provide 
that an issuer of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares must promptly notify the 
Exchange of any non-compliance with 
any of the applicable continued listing 
standards set forth in Rule 8.201 
(Generic). Proposed Rule 8.201(k) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(k) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Rule 8.201(l) (Generic) would set forth 
rules relating to trading halts. Proposed 
Rule 8.201(l)(1) (Generic) would provide 
that the Exchange may halt trading 
during the day in which the 
interruption to the following occurs: (i) 
the value of the underlying reference 
asset(s) or index is not made widely 
available on at least a 15-second basis 
from a source unaffiliated with the 
sponsor or the Trust; (ii) the Indicative 
Trust Value is not made widely 
available to all market participants at 
the same time on at least a 15-second 
basis during the Core Trading Session; 
or (iii) the information required by 
proposed Rule 8.201(e) (Generic) to be 
publicly disclosed on a Trust’s website, 
free of charge, is not being disclosed in 
that manner. If the interruption persists 
past the trading day in which it 
occurred, the Exchange will halt trading 
no later than the beginning of the 
trading day following the interruption. 
If Commodity-Based Trust Shares are 
trading on the Exchange pursuant to 
unlisted trading privileges, the 
Exchange will halt trading as specified 
in Rule 7.34(a). Proposed Rule 
8.201(l)(2) (Generic) would provide that, 
if the Exchange becomes aware that the 
net asset value is not disseminated to all 
the market participants at the same 
time, it will halt trading in the 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares until 
such time as the net asset value is 
available to all market participants. 
Finally, proposed Rule 8.201(l)(3) 
(Generic) would provide that the 
Exchange also may halt trading because 
of market conditions or for reasons that, 
in the view of the Exchange, make 
trading in the Shares inadvisable. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(l) (Generic) is 
based on NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(l) 
(Generic), with a non-substantive 
change in proposed Rule 8.201(l)(1) to 
refer to Rule 7.34 instead of Rule 7.34– 
E. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(m) (Generic) 
would set forth rules related to Market 
Maker accounts. A Market Maker in 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares listed 
pursuant to Rule 8.201 (Generic) must 
file with the Exchange in a manner 
prescribed by the Exchange and keep 
current a list identifying all accounts for 
trading in each underlying commodity 
and commodity-based asset which the 
Market Maker may have or over which 
it may exercise investment discretion. If 
a Market Maker in Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares that have exposure to, but 
do not, consistent with the definition of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares in this 
Rule 8.201 (Generic), hold one or more 
non-U.S. currencies (‘‘Underlying FX’’), 
such Market Maker also must file with 
the Exchange, in a manner prescribed by 
the Exchange, and keep current a list 
identifying all accounts for trading in 
Underlying FX and derivatives 
overlying Underlying FX which the 
Market Maker may have or over which 
it may exercise investment discretion, as 
well as a list of all commodity and 
commodity-related accounts referenced 
above. No Market Maker in Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares shall trade in a 
commodity, commodity-based asset, 
Underlying FX, or any related derivative 
thereon in an account that the Market 
Maker (1) directly or indirectly controls 
trading activities or has direct interest in 
the profits or losses thereof, (2) is 
required by this rule to disclose to the 
Exchange, and (3) has not reported to 
the Exchange. In addition to the existing 
obligations under Exchange rules 
regarding the production of books and 
records, a Market Maker in Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares shall make available 
to the Exchange such books, records or 
other information pertaining to 
transactions by such entity or registered 
or non-registered employee affiliated 
with such entity for its or their own 
accounts for trading the underlying 
commodity or commodity-based asset, 
applicable Underlying FX, or applicable 
derivatives of each of the foregoing, as 
may be requested by the Exchange. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(m) (Generic) is 
based on current Rule 8.201(g) without 
any substantive changes, as well as on 
NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E(m) (Generic) 
with non-substantive changes to refer to 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) instead of Rule 
8.201–E(Generic) and to replace 
references to ETP Holders with 
references to member organizations. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(n) (Generic) 
would provide for the establishment of 
firewalls. Specifically, proposed Rule 
8.201(n)(1) (Generic) would provide 
that, if the value of a Commodity-Based 
Trust Share listed pursuant to Rule 
8.201 (Generic) is based in whole or in 
part on an index that is maintained by 
a broker-dealer, the broker-dealer shall

erect and maintain a ‘‘firewall’’ around 
the personnel responsible for the 
maintenance of such index or who have 
access to information concerning 
changes and adjustments to the index. 
Proposed Rule 8.201(n)(2) (Generic) 
would provide that any advisory 
committee, supervisory board, or similar 
entity that advises an index licensor or 
administrator or that makes decisions 
regarding the index composition 
methodology, and related matters must 
implement and maintain, or be subject 
to, procedures designed to prevent the 
use and dissemination of material, non- 
public information regarding the 
applicable index. Proposed Rule 
8.201(n)(3) (Generic) would provide 
that, if the Trust is affiliated with any 
entity that has the ability to influence 
the price or supply of a commodity, or 
a commodity underlying a commodity- 
based asset, held by the Trust, the Trust 
shall (i) implement and maintain a 
‘‘firewall’’ between any such entity and 
the Trust, (ii) have written policies and 
procedures designed to prevent the use 
and dissemination of material, non- 
public information regarding the Trust; 
and (iii) have written policies and 
procedures designed to prevent 
fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative 
acts, practices, or courses of business 
with respect to the Trust and such 
commodity. Proposed Rule 8.201(n) 
(Generic) is based on NYSE Arca Rule 
8.201–E(n) (Generic), with a non- 
substantive change in proposed Rule 
8.201(n)(1) to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Proposed Rule 8.201(o) would set 
forth rules relating to the limitation of 
Exchange liability. Neither the Exchange 
nor any agent of the Exchange shall 
have any liability for damages, claims, 
losses or expenses caused by any errors, 
omissions, or delays in calculating or 
disseminating any underlying 
commodity value, the current value of 
the underlying commodity required to 
be deposited to the Trust in connection 
with issuance of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares pursuant to Rule 8.201 
(Generic); resulting from any negligent 
act or omission by the Exchange, or any 
agent of the Exchange, or any act, 
condition or cause beyond the 
reasonable control of the Exchange, its 
agent, including, but not limited to, an 
act of God; fire; flood; extraordinary 
weather conditions; war; insurrection; 
riot; strike; accident; action of 
government; communications or power 
failure; equipment or software 
malfunction; or any error, omission or 
delay in the reports of transactions in an 
underlying commodity. Proposed Rule 
8.201(o) (Generic) is based on current 
Rule 8.201(f), as well as on NYSE Arca 
Rule 8.201–E(o) (Generic) with a non- 
substantive change to refer to Rule 8.201 
(Generic) instead of Rule 8.201–E 
(Generic). 
Finally, the Exchange proposes 
Commentary to Rule 8.201 (Generic) as 
follows. Proposed Commentary .01 
would provide that the Exchange 
requires that member organizations 
provide all purchasers of newly issued 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares a 
prospectus for the series of Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares. Proposed 
Commentary .01 is based on current 
Rule 8.201, Commentary .02 without 
any changes, as well as Commentary .01 
to NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E (Generic) 
with a non-substantive change to refer 
to member organizations instead of ETP 
Holders. Proposed Commentary .02 
would provide that transactions in 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares will 
occur during the trading hours specified 
in NYSE Arca Rule 7.34. Proposed 
Commentary .02 is based on current 
Rule 8.201, Commentary .03 without 
any changes, as well as Commentary .02 
to NYSE Arca Rule 8.201–E (Generic) 
with a non-substantive change to 
reference Rule 7.34 instead of Rule 
7.34–E. 
Proposed Conforming Changes 
The Exchange proposes conforming 
changes to Rule 5.2(j)(6), which 
provides that Commodity-Linked 
Securities provide for payment at 
maturity based on the performance of 
one or more physical commodities or 
commodity futures, options or other 
commodity derivatives or Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares (as defined in Rule 
8.201) or a basket or index of any of the 
foregoing. The Exchange proposes a 
conforming change to Rule 5.2(j)(6) to 
specify that the reference to 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares is as 
defined in Rule 8.201 (Non-Generic) or 
Rule 8.201 (Generic) to ensure that this 
rule accommodates Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares listed pursuant to either 
rule. 
The Exchange also proposes 
conforming changes to Section 302.00 of 
the NYSE Listed Company Manual, 
which sets forth requirements related to 
annual meetings. The Exchange 
proposes to amend Section 302.00 to 
include Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
listed pursuant to Rule 8.201 (Generic) 
in the list of securities for which the 
requirements concerning annual 
meetings do not apply and to update the 
title of current Rule 8.201 to be Rule 
8.201 (Non-Generic). 
2. Statutory Basis 
The proposed rule change is 
consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,
9
 
in general, and furthers the objectives of 
Section 6(b)(5),
10
in particular, because 
it is designed to prevent fraudulent and 
manipulative acts and practices, to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, to foster cooperation and 
coordination with persons engaged in 
facilitating transactions in securities, to 
remove impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest. 
The Exchange believes proposed Rule 
8.201 (Generic) would promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, remove 
impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and 
protect investors and the public interest 
by establishing generic standards for 
listing and trading of Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares. Proposed Rule 8.201 
(Generic) would allow Commodity- 
Based Trust Shares that meet the 
requirements of the Rule to be listed and 
traded on the Exchange without prior 
Commission approval order or notice of 
effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b) 
of the Act. Accordingly, the proposed 
rule change would promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, remove 
impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and 
protect investors and the public interest 
because it would facilitate efficient 
procedures for listing Commodity-Based 
Trust Shares that meet the requirements 
of proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic), 
thereby reducing the time, resources, 
and costs associated with bringing new 
series of Commodity-Based Trust Shares 
to market and promoting competition 
among issuers of such products, to the 
benefit of the market participants. In 
addition, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change would further the 
intended objective of Rule 19b–4(e) 
under the Act by permitting 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares that 
satisfy the proposed listing standards in 
proposed Rule 8.201 (Generic) to be 
listed and traded without separate 
Commission approval. 
The Exchange further believes that the 
proposed changes would promote just 
and equitable principles of trade, 
remove impediments to, and perfect the 
mechanism of, a free and open market 
and a national market system, and 
protect investors and the public interest

because the proposed rules are based on 
the rules of the Exchange’s affiliated 
market, NYSE Arca, which rules have 
been approved by the Commission. 
Accordingly, the proposed rule changes 
would facilitate the Exchange’s ability 
to list and trade Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares under generic listing standards 
identical to NYSE Arca’s. The Exchange 
also believes that the proposed rule 
change would remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system by promoting consistency across 
the rules of affiliated exchanges. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. Instead, the 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
rule change would facilitate the listing 
and trading of Commodity-Based Trust 
Shares through an efficient process that 
would enhance competition among 
market participants, to the benefit of 
investors and the marketplace. The 
Exchange believes that the proposed 
generic listing standards in Rule 8.201 
(Generic) would reduce the timeframe 
for bringing additional series of 
Commodity-Based Trust Shares to 
market, thereby reducing the burdens on 
issuers and other market participants 
and promoting competition among 
issuers of such products. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
No written comments were solicited 
or received with respect to the proposed 
rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Within 45 days of the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period 
to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which 
the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission will: 
(A) by order approve or disapprove 
the proposed rule change, or 
(B) institute proceedings to determine 
whether the proposed rule change 
should be disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change, is consistent with the Act. 
Comments may be submitted by any of 
the following methods:

Background: The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period 
soliciting comments on the following 
collection of information was published 
on August 30, 2024 (89 FR 70681). 
Public Law 103–272 states that all 
aircraft must be registered before they 
may be flown. It sets forth registration 
eligibility requirements and provides for 
application for registration as well as 
suspension and/or revocation of

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61216 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices registration. The information collected 
is required by any party wishing to 
register an aircraft. The FAA also 
collects information to process requests 
from private aircraft owners or operators 
to withhold from board dissemination 
or display by the FAA the personally 
identifiable information of such 
individuals, including on the FAA’s 
publicly available website, in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 44114(b). 
The Aircraft Registry has determined 
there is a need to create two new forms 
for this collection as follows: AC Form 
8050–88UA, Affidavit of Ownership for 
Unmanned Aircraft (UA) and AC Form 
8050–138, Declaration of International 
Operation. 
The AC Form 8050–88UA was created 
to make it easier for registration 
applicants to supply the FAA Aircraft 
Registry with the minimal information 
needed to register a UA. Most UA 
owners don’t have the required 
evidence of ownership to register. The 
affidavit will be used in lieu of a 
recordable bill of sale for any new 
registrations. The registrant may still 
submit any other proof of ownership 
with the affidavit or declare that 
evidence of ownership is not available. 
The new form will collect the following 
information about the UA: registration 
number, name of manufacturer/builder, 
model, serial number, class, engine 
type, number of engines, number of 
seats, max takeoff weight and how/ 
where the UA was purchased. 
The AC Form 8050–138 was created 
to allow registrants to request priority 
handling of their registration documents 
due to an impending international 
flight. The Aircraft Registry is required 
to process all incoming documents in 
the order of their receipt. An aircraft last 
previously registered in the United 
States may be operated within the 
United States under temporary authority 
(see 14 CFR 47.31), so long as a second copy of the Aircraft Registration 
Application is carried in the aircraft. 
The temporary authority is valid until 
the date the applicant receives the 
Certificate of Aircraft Registration or 
until the date the FAA denies the 
application, or 12 months have passed 
since the receipt of the first application 
following transfer of ownership by the 
last registered owner. There are 
instances where applicants need to fly 
aircraft outside the continental United 
States. Many of those applicants are 
major Air Carriers and small businesses. 
When an applicant files a Declaration of 
International Operation, AC Form 8050– 
138, the applicant’s registration 
documents will be worked on a priority 
basis, alleviating any undue hardship. 
The form will collect the aircraft 
description and pertinent information 
about the scheduled international flight: 
date of flight, flight number, departing 
location and destination location. 
The Aircraft Security Agreement, AC 
Form 8050–98, has been removed from 
this collection and moved to OMB 
2120–0043, Recording of Aircraft 
Conveyances and Security Documents.

Volkswagen Group of America, Inc., 
Grant of Petition for Decision of 
Inconsequential Noncompliance 
AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 
Department of Transportation (DOT). 
ACTION: Grant of petition. SUMMARY: Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (Volkswagen), has 
determined that certain model year 
(MY) 2019–2020 Audi A6, MY 2019– 
2020 Audi A7, and MY 2020 Audi A6 
Allroad motor vehicles do not fully 
comply with Federal Motor Vehicle 
Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 110, Tire 
Selection and Rims and Motor Home/ 
Recreation Vehicle Trailer Load 
Carrying Capacity Information for Motor 
Vehicles with a GVWR of 4,536 
Kilograms (10,000 pounds) or less. 
Volkswagen filed a noncompliance 
report dated May 20, 2020. Volkswagen 
simultaneously petitioned NHTSA on 
May 20, 2020, for a decision that the 
subject noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety. This notice announces 
the grant of Volkswagen’s petition. 
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:

Compliance, the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Overview: Volkswagen has 
determined that certain MY 2019–2020 
Audi A6, MY 2019–2020 Audi A7, and 
MY 2020 Audi A6 Allroad motor 
vehicles do not fully comply with the 
requirements of paragraph S4.3(c) of 
FMVSS No. 110, Tire Selection and 
Rims and Motor Home/Recreation 
Vehicle Trailer Load Carrying Capacity 
Information for Motor Vehicles with a 
GVWR of 4,536 Kilograms (10,000 
pounds) or Less (49 CFR 571.110). 
Volkswagen filed a noncompliance 
report dated May 20, 2020, pursuant to 
49 CFR part 573, Defect and 
Noncompliance Responsibility and 
Reports. Volkswagen simultaneously petitioned NHTSA on May 20, 2020, for 
an exemption from the notification and 
remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. 
Chapter 301 on the basis that this 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety, pursuant 
to 49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 30120(h) and 
49 CFR part 556, Exemption for 
Inconsequential Defect or 
Noncompliance. 
Notice of receipt of Volkswagen’s 
petition was published with a 30-day 
public comment period, on October 23, 
2020, in the Federal Register (85 FR 
67605). No comments were received. To 
view the petition and all supporting 
documents, log onto the Federal Docket 
Management System (FDMS) website at 
https://www.regulations.gov/. Then follow the online search instructions to 
locate docket number ‘‘NHTSA–2020– 
0082.’’ 
II. Vehicles Involved: Approximately 
652 MY 2019–2020 Audi A6, MY 2019– 
2020 Audi A7, and MY 2020 Audi A6 
Allroad motor vehicles, manufactured 
between September 24, 2018, and May 
14, 2020, are potentially involved. 
III. Noncompliance: Volkswagen 
explains that the noncompliance is that 
the subject vehicles are equipped with 
a tire placard label (located on the 
driver’s side B-pillar) that was 
incorrectly printed to include cold tire 
inflation pressure information for a 
spare tire that is not present in the 
affected vehicles and therefore, does not 
meet the requirements specified in 
paragraph S4.3(c) of FMVSS No. 110. 
Specifically, since the subject vehicles 
are not equipped with a spare tire, the 
tire placard label should contain the 
word ‘‘none’’ in the cold tire inflation 
pressure section. 
IV. FMVSS Requirements: Paragraph 
S4.3(c) of FMVSS No. 110 includes the 
requirements relevant to this petition. If 
no spare tire is provided, the word 
‘‘none’’ must replace the manufacturer’s 
recommended cold tire inflation 
pressure. 
V. Summary of Volkswagen’s Petition: 
The following views and arguments 
presented in this section, ‘‘V. Summary 
of Volkswagen’s Petition,’’ are the views 
and arguments provided by Volkswagen 
and do not reflect the views of NHTSA. 
Volkswagen describes the subject 
noncompliance and contends that the 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety. 
In support of its petition, Volkswagen 
offers the following reasoning: 
Volkswagen contends that the subject 
noncompliance does not affect the 
subject vehicle’s drivability, safety, or 
tire wear because the incorrect 
information provided on the tire placard 
label pertains to a spare tire that is not 
equipped on the vehicle. Volkswagen 
reports that as of May 15, 2020, the 
subject noncompliance has been 
corrected in production. Volkswagen 
says that the affected vehicles held at 
the factory, as well as unsold vehicles 
in dealer inventory, will be corrected 
before being sold. Volkswagen adds that 
it is unaware of any field or customer 
complaints related to the subject 
noncompliance, nor is it aware of any 
accidents or injuries occurring as a 
result of the subject noncompliance. 
Volkswagen concludes by contending 
that the subject noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety, and that its petition to be 
exempted from providing notification of 
the noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30118, and a remedy for the 
noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30120, should be granted. 
Volkswagen’s complete petition and 
all supporting documents are available 
on https://www.regulations.gov by following the online search instructions 
to locate the docket number as listed in 
the title of this notice. 
VI. NHTSA’s Analysis: The burden of 
establishing the inconsequentiality of a 
failure to comply with a performance 
requirement in an FMVSS is substantial 
and difficult to meet. Accordingly, 
NHTSA has not found many such 
noncompliances inconsequential.
1
 
In determining the inconsequentiality 
of a noncompliance, NHTSA focuses on 
the safety risk to individuals who 
experience the type of event against 
which a recall would otherwise 
protect.
2
In general, NHTSA does not 
consider the absence of complaints or 
injuries when determining if a 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
safety. The absence of complaints does 
not mean vehicle occupants have not 
experienced a safety issue, nor does it 
mean that there will not be safety issues 
in the future.

Further, because each

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61218 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices poses an unreasonable risk when it ‘‘results in 
hazards as potentially dangerous as sudden engine 
fire, and where there is no dispute that at least some 
such hazards, in this case fires, can definitely be 
expected to occur in the future’’). 
inconsequential noncompliance petition 
must be evaluated on its own facts and 
determinations are highly fact- 
dependent, NHTSA does not consider 
prior determinations as binding 
precedent. Petitioners are reminded that 
they have the burden of persuading 
NHTSA that the noncompliance is 
inconsequential to safety. 
Volkswagen explains that the 
noncompliance is that the vehicle 
placard on the subject vehicles states a 
cold inflation pressure for the spare 
tires, but no spare tire was equipped 
and the placard should state ‘‘none.’’ 
The intent of FMVSS No. 110 is to 
ensure that vehicles are equipped with 
tires appropriate to handle maximum 
vehicle loads and to prevent 
overloading. 
FMVSS No. 110 requires that the 
original tires installed on a vehicle and 
the tires listed on the vehicle placard be 
appropriate for the maximum loading 
conditions of the vehicle. However, the 
vehicles at issue are neither intended to 
have a spare tire or be equipped with a 
spare tire even though a cold inflation 
pressure is erroneously listed for the 
spare tire on the vehicle placard with no 
other information for the spare tire size. 
Since there is no spare tire size listed on 
the placard, the subject vehicles would 
not be at risk of being overloaded with 
only a cold inflation pressure 
information listed. 
Given the above factors, NHTSA 
agrees with Volkswagen that the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety and that there is no 
risk of possible underinflating or 
overloading spare tires that are not 
present in the subject vehicles. 
VII. NHTSA’s Decision: In 
consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA 
finds that Volkswagen has met its 
burden of persuasion that the subject 
FMVSS No. 110 noncompliance in the 
affected vehicles is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, 
Volkswagen’s petition is hereby granted, 
and Volkswagen is consequently 
exempted from the obligation of 
providing notification of, and a free 
remedy for, that noncompliance under 
49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120. 
NHTSA notes that the statutory 
provisions (49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 
30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to 
file petitions for a determination of 
inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to 
exempt manufacturers only from the 
duties found in sections 30118 and 
30120, respectively, to notify owners, 
purchasers, and dealers of a defect or 
noncompliance and to remedy the 
defect or noncompliance. Therefore, this 
decision only applies to the subject 
vehicles that Volkswagen no longer 
controlled at the time it determined that 
the noncompliance existed. However, 
the granting of this petition does not 
relieve vehicle distributors and dealers 
of the prohibitions on the sale, offer for 
sale, or introduction or delivery for 
introduction into interstate commerce of 
the noncompliant vehicles under their 
control after Volkswagen notified them 
that the subject noncompliance existed.

V. Summary of EMV’s Petition 
The following views and arguments 
presented in this section, ‘‘V. Summary 
of EMV’s Petition,’’ are the views and 
arguments provided by EMV and do not 
reflect the views of the Agency. In its 
petition, EMV describes the subject 
noncompliance and contends that the 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety. 
In support of its petition, EMV offers 
the following reasoning: 
1. EMV states that the absence of the 
manufacturer name, trademark, or 
symbol does not have any effect on the 
operation, performance, or safety of the 
affected vehicles. In support of this 
argument, EMV points out that the 
manufacturer name, trademark, or 
symbol is not required to be marked on 
rims for use on passenger cars in 
accordance with FMVSS No. 110. EMV 
acknowledges that the marking is 
helpful for traceability in the event of 
the future discovery of a wheel defect. 
However, EMV states that the absence of 
the marking on the affected rims does 
not inhibit traceability because EMV has 
only a single supply source for the 
pertinent rim style. EMV notes that the 
affected rims do contain other markings, 
such as the date of manufacture, heat 
treatment lot, and all other markings 
required as per FMVSS No. 120, 
paragraph S5.2, providing for sufficient 
traceability of any given rim. EMV also 
relays that it is not aware of any crashes, 
injuries, or customer complaints 
associated with the absence of the rim 
manufacturer name, trademark, or 
symbol marking. 
2. EMV states the granting of its 
petition for inconsequential 
noncompliance would be consistent 
with previous NHTSA decisions 
regarding FMVSS No. 120 and FMVSS 
No. 110 (for vehicles other than 
passenger cars) requirements for rim 
markings. In support of its petition EMV 
cites the granting of inconsequential 
noncompliance petitions for both the 
incorrect marking of the rim size in 
2017
1
and the absence of required rim 
markings in 2008.
2
 
3. EMV also states that all affected MY 
2018 and MY 2019 vehicles under its 
control in, or destined for, the United 
States have been or are in the process 
of being brought into compliance with 
the FMVSS No. 120 manufacturer 
marking requirements. EMV adds that it 
has also ensured that all required 
markings will be present on rims used 
for future production. 
EMV concludes that the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety and 
contends that its petition to be 
exempted from providing notification of 
the noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30118, and a remedy for the 
noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30120, should be granted. 
NHTSA’s Analysis 
In determining inconsequentiality of a 
noncompliance, NHTSA focuses on the 
safety risk to individuals who 
experience the type of event against 
which a recall would otherwise 
protect.
3
In general, NHTSA does not 
consider the absence of complaints or 
injuries when determining if a 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
safety. The absence of complaints does 
not mean vehicle occupants have not 
experienced a safety issue, nor does it 
mean that there will not be safety issues 
in the future.
4
Further, because each 
inconsequential noncompliance petition 
must be evaluated on its own facts and 
determinations are highly fact- 
dependent, NHTSA does not consider 
prior determinations as binding 
precedent. Petitioners are reminded that 
they have the burden of persuading 
NHTSA that the noncompliance is 
inconsequential to safety. 
Arguments that only a small number 
of vehicles or items of motor vehicle 
equipment are affected also do not 
justify granting an inconsequentiality 
petition.
5
Similarly, mere assertions that 
only a small percentage of vehicles or 
items of equipment are likely to actually 
exhibit a noncompliance are 
unpersuasive. The percentage of 
potential occupants that could be 
adversely affected by a noncompliance 
is not relevant to whether the 
noncompliance poses an 
inconsequential risk to safety. Rather, 
NHTSA focuses on the consequence to 
an occupant who is exposed to the 
consequence of that noncompliance.
6
 
The Safety Act is preventive, and 
manufacturers cannot and should not 
wait for deaths or injuries to occur in 
their vehicles before they carry out a 
recall.
7
Indeed, the very purpose of a 
recall is to protect individuals from 
risk.
8
NHTSA has evaluated the merits 
of EMV’s petition and is granting the 
petitioner’s request for an exemption 
from the notification and remedy 
requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 49 
U.S.C. 30120. The Agency considered 
the following prior to making this 
determination: 
EMV states in its petition and 
noncompliance report that the 
noncompliance is that a subset of MY 18 
SOLOs equipped with silver rims with 
12 spokes are missing the required 
marking of the manufacturer’s name, 
trademark, or symbol and therefore do 
not comply with the requirements of 
paragraph S5.2(d) of FMVSS No. 120. 
EMV explains that a miscommunication 
between EMV and the rim manufacturer 
resulted in the absence of the 
manufacturer marking required for 
motorcycles in accordance with FMVSS 
No. 120 S5.2(d). EMV confirms that four 
of the affected MY18 SOLOs shipped to 
the U.S. between November 2018 and 
July 2019 equipped with the affected 
rims have been sold to consumers, and 
that all other affected MY18 and MY19 
vehicles in the U.S. have been or are in 
the process of being brought into 
compliance with the marking 
requirement. EMV states that no remedy 
or reimbursement program is planned 
for the affected vehicles. 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:02 Dec 29, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00106 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\30DEN1.SGM 30DEN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES61220 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Notices EMV explains it has only one source 
for supply of the pertinent rim style and 
that the absence of the manufacturer 
name, trademark, or symbol marking 
will therefore not inhibit traceability of 
the affected rims. It further states that 
other markings present, such as the date 
of manufacture and all other required 
rim markings from paragraph S5.2, 
(including some not required, such as 
‘‘heat treatment lot’’), provide for 
sufficient traceability of any given rim. 
Given the nature of the vehicle, the 
markings present on the rim, and the 
rim’s unique design, it appears most 
likely that if a consumer encountered a 
problem with the rim, including finding 
a proper replacement, they could 
contact the vehicle manufacturer for 
further assistance or, if seeking a 
replacement, replace the rim based on 
the correct tire rim size present on the 
side of the rim. The aforementioned 
facts support a conclusion that the 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety, as all other 
information markings as required by 
FMVSS No. 120 are correctly marked. 
NHTSA’s Decision 
In consideration of the foregoing, 
NHTSA finds that EMV has met its 
burden of persuasion that the subject 
FMVSS No. 120 noncompliance at issue 
is inconsequential to motor vehicle 
safety. Accordingly, EMV’s petition is 
hereby granted and EMV is 
consequently exempt from the 
obligation of providing notification of, 
and a free remedy for, that 
noncompliance under 49 U.S.C. 30118 
and 30120. 
NHTSA notes that the statutory 
provisions (49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 
30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to 
file petitions for a determination of 
inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to 
exempt manufacturers only from the 
duties found in sections 30118 and 
30120, respectively, to notify owners, 
purchasers, and dealers of a defect or 
noncompliance and to remedy the 
defect or noncompliance. Therefore, this 
decision only applies to the subject 
vehicles that EMV no longer controlled 
at the time it determined that the 
noncompliance existed. However, the 
granting of this petition does not relieve 
vehicle distributors and dealers of the 
prohibitions on the sale, offer for sale, 
or introduction or delivery for 
introduction into interstate commerce of 
the noncompliant motorcycles under 
their control after EMV notified them 
that the subject noncompliance existed.

ACTION: Grant of petition. SUMMARY: Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (Goodyear), has determined 
that certain Goodyear Convenience 
Spare tires do not fully comply with 
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 
(FMVSS) No. 109, New Pneumatic and 
Certain Specialty Tires. Goodyear filed 
an original noncompliance report dated 
June 8, 2021, and subsequently, 
Goodyear petitioned NHTSA on June 
21, 2021, for a decision that the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety. This 
notice announces the grant of 
Goodyear’s petition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Overview: Goodyear has determined 
that certain Goodyear Convenience 
Spare tires do not fully comply with the 
requirements of paragraph S4.2.1(c) and 
S4.3(c) of FMVSS No. 109, New 
Pneumatic and Certain Specialty Tires 
(49 CFR 571.109). Goodyear filed a 
noncompliance report dated June 8, 
2021, pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, 
Defect and Noncompliance 
Responsibility and Reports. Goodyear 
subsequently petitioned NHTSA on 
June 21, 2021, for an exemption from 
the notification and remedy 
requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 
on the basis that this noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
30118(d) and 30120(h) and 49 CFR part 
556, Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance. 
Notice of receipt of Goodyear’s 
petition was published with a 30-day 
public comment period, on December 
14, 2021, in the Federal Register (86 FR 
71118). No comments were received. To 
view the petition and all supporting 
documents log onto the Federal Docket 
Management System (FDMS) website at 
https://www.regulations.gov/. Then follow the online search instructions to 
locate docket number ‘‘NHTSA–2021– 
0046.’’ 
II. Tires Involved: Approximately 534 
Goodyear Convenience Spare tires, size 
T155/70D17 110M SL, manufactured 
between February 15, 2021, and April 8, 
2021, were reported by the 
manufacturer. 
III. Rule Requirements: Paragraphs 
S4.2.1(c) and S4.3(c) of FMVSS No. 109 
include the requirements relevant to 
this petition. Each tire shall conform to 
each of the following: Its load rating 
shall be that specified in a submission 
made by an individual manufacturer, 
pursuant to paragraph S4.2.1(a), or in 
one of the publications described in 
paragraph S4.4.1(b) for its size 
designation, type, and each appropriate 
inflation pressure. If the maximum load 
rating for a particular tire size is shown 
in more than one of the publications 
described in paragraph S4.4.1(b), each 
tire of that size designation shall have 
a maximum load rating that is not less 
than the published maximum load 
rating, or if there are differing maximum 
load ratings for the same tire size 
designation, not less than the lowest 
published maximum load rating. Except 
as provided in paragraphs S4.3.1 and 
S4.3.2 of this standard, each tire, except 
for those certified to comply with 
paragraph S5.5 of § 571.139, shall have 
permanently molded into or onto both 
sidewalls, in letters and numerals not 
less than 0.078 inches high, the 
information shown in paragraphs S4.3 
(a) through (g) of this standard. 
Paragraph 4.3(c) specifies the maximum 
load rating. 
IV. Noncompliance: Goodyear 
explains that the noncompliance is that 
the subject tires incorrectly state the 
maximum load in kg on one sidewall of 
the tire and, therefore, do not comply 
with the requirements specified in 
paragraphs S4.2.1(c) and S4.3(c) of 
FMVSS No. 109. Specifically, the 
subject tires are marked on one sidewall 
with ‘‘Max Load 1,080 kg (2,337 lbs)’’, 
when they should have been marked 
with ‘‘Max Load 1,060 kg (2,337 lbs)’’.

poses an unreasonable risk when it ‘‘results in 
hazards as potentially dangerous as sudden engine 
fire, and where there is no dispute that at least some 
such hazards, in this case fires, can definitely be 
expected to occur in the future’’). 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety. 
In support of its petition, Goodyear 
submitted the following reasoning: 
1. Goodyear says that ‘‘the subject 
tires were manufactured as designed 
and meet or exceed’’ the relevant 
FMVSSs. 
2. Goodyear also states the subject 
tires are ‘‘original equipment on several 
Toyota and Subaru vehicle models and 
were designed and manufactured to 
meet or exceed the specified vehicle 
loading conditions as specified by the 
vehicle manufacturers.’’ 
3. According to Goodyear, ‘‘[t]he 110 
numerical Load Index marked on the 
tire as part of the Service Description 
(110M) is correct as marked.’’ 
4. Goodyear claims the subject tires 
‘‘that were mismarked Max Load 1,080 
kg in place of Max Load 1,060 kg met 
the performance requirements of 
FMVSS No. 109 for endurance and high 
speed when tested at the 1,080 kg load.’’ 
5. Goodyear says the subject tires ‘‘are 
marked correctly for Max Load in 
pounds. on both sides of the tire. 
Further, Goodyear says the subject tires 
are primarily sold in the domestic 
original equipment market, where the 
load in pounds would be the 
predominant consumer unit of 
measurement.’’ 
6. Goodyear says the subject tires are 
‘‘marked in letters 20-mm high 
‘TEMPORARY USE ONLY’ as they are 
convenience spare tires.’’ 
7. Goodyear contends that NHTSA 
has previously granted petitions for 
similar noncompliances ‘‘related to tire 
loading labeling information on tires 
and previous NHTSA surveys have 
shown most consumers do not base tire 
purchases on tire labeling information 
found on the tire sidewall.’’ Further, 
Goodyear claims, since the subject tires 
are temporary use only spare tires, any 
considerations about what information 
consumers rely on for tire purchases is 
even less of a concern. 
Goodyear concludes that the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety and that 
its petition to be exempted from 
providing notification of the 
noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30118, and a remedy for the 
noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30120, should be granted. 
VI. NHTSA’s Analysis: In determining 
inconsequentiality of a noncompliance, 
NHTSA focuses on the safety risk to 
individuals who experience the type of 
event against which a recall would 
otherwise protect.
1
In general, NHTSA 
does not consider the absence of 
complaints or injuries when 
determining if a noncompliance is 
inconsequential to safety. The absence 
of complaints does not mean vehicle 
occupants have not experienced a safety 
issue, nor does it mean that there will 
not be safety issues in the future.
2
 
Further, because each inconsequential 
noncompliance petition must be 
evaluated on its own facts and 
determinations are highly fact- 
dependent, NHTSA does not consider 
prior determinations as binding 
precedent. Petitioners are reminded that 
they have the burden of persuading 
NHTSA that the noncompliance is 
inconsequential to safety.NHTSA has 
evaluated the merits of Goodyear’s 
petition and based on the specific facts 
of this case, believes that the incorrect 
max load value in kilograms (kg) 
marked on one sidewall on the subject 
tires is not consequential to safety given 
the totality of fact and circumstances 
detailed below: 
€The affected population of tires were sent to vehicle manufacturers for 
use as T-type spares for specific 
vehicles. These tires, though incorrectly 
marked, were designed to meet or 
exceed the vehicle loading conditions of 
the vehicles on which they were sold. 
For this reason, NHTSA believes that 
the tires are unlikely to be overloaded. 
€None of the affected tires were sent to distributors for sale in the 
replacement market where the incorrect 
load value could lead to overloading if 
tire users relied upon the incorrect 
maximum load marked on the tire. 
€NHTSA has no basis to believe that the subject tires do not meet the 
performance requirements of FMVSS 
No. 109. Additionally, Goodyear stated 
that the affected population meets the 
performance requirements of FMVSS 
No. 109 when tested at the maximum 
load value of 1080kg. 
€Any potential risk to the public is further reduced because T-type 
temporary use spare tires are not 
frequently used, and when used are 
only intended for short duration use 
until a flat tire can be repaired or 
replaced. 
€If the spare tires need to be replaced, the correct load index value 
‘‘110’’ is marked on both sidewalls of 
the subject tires. 
€The maximum load expressed in pounds (lbs) is correct on both 
sidewalls. The maximum load 
expressed in kilograms (kg) is correct on 
one sidewall. 
€Because the subject tires are exclusively sold as original equipment 
items on new vehicles, the traceability 
of these tires is through the registration 
of vehicles vs. registration of the tires 
themselves. Additionally, the TIN is 
unaffected meaning that consumers will 
be able to identify the tires in the event 
of a safety recall. 
VII. NHTSA’s Decision: In 
consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA 
has decided that Goodyear has met its 
burden of persuasion that the subject 
FMVSS No. 109 noncompliance in the 
affected tires is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, 
Goodyear’s petition is hereby granted 
and Goodyear is consequently exempted 
from the obligation of providing 
notification of, and a free remedy for, 
that noncompliance under 49 U.S.C. 
30118 and 30120. 
NHTSA notes that the statutory 
provisions (49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 
30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to 
file petitions for a determination of 
inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to 
exempt manufacturers only from the 
duties found in sections 30118 and 
30120, respectively, to notify owners, 
purchasers, and dealers of a defect or 
noncompliance and to remedy the 
defect or noncompliance. Therefore, this 
decision only applies to the subject tires 
that Goodyear no longer controlled at 
the time it determined that the 
noncompliance existed. However, the 
granting of this petition does not relieve 
tire distributors and dealers of the 
prohibitions on the sale, offer for sale, 
or introduction or delivery for 
introduction into interstate commerce of 
the noncompliant tires under their 
control after Goodyear notified them 
that the subject noncompliance existed.

Chapter 301 on the basis that this 
noncompliance is inconsequential as it 
relates to motor vehicle safety, pursuant 
to 49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 30120(h) and 
49 CFR part 556, Exemption for 
Inconsequential Defect or 
Noncompliance. 
Notice of receipt of Toyota’s petition

II. Vehicles Involved: Approximately 
661 MY 2023 Subaru Solterra and 
Toyota bZ4X motor vehicles, 
manufactured between March 30, 2022, 
and June 3, 2022, were reported by the 
manufacturer. 
III. Noncompliance: Toyota explains 
that the noncompliance is that the 
subject vehicles are equipped with a tire 
information placard that incorrectly 
identifies the vehicle weight capacity of 
the subject vehicles and, therefore, do 
not comply with FMVSS No. 110. 
Specifically, the tire information 
placard incorrectly states that the 
vehicle weight capacity is 925 pounds 
when it should state that the vehicle 
weight capacity is 1,045 pounds. 
IV. Rule Requirements: Paragraph 
S4.3(a) of FMVSS No. 110 of FMVSS 
No. 110 includes the requirements 
relevant to this petition. Paragraph S4.3 
of FMVSS No. 110 provides that each 
vehicle, except for a trailer or 
incomplete vehicle, is required to show 
the vehicle weight capacity on a placard 
permanently affixed to the driver’s side 
B-pillar. In each vehicle without a 
driver’s side B-pillar and with two doors 
on the driver’s side of the vehicle 
opening in opposite directions, the 
placard shall be affixed on the forward 
edge of the rear side door. If the above 
locations do not permit the affixing of 
a placard that is legible, visible, and 
prominent, the placard shall be 
permanently affixed to the rear edge of 
the driver’s side door. If this location 
does not permit the affixing of a placard 
that is legible, visible, and prominent, 
the placard shall be affixed to the 
inward facing surface of the vehicle next 
to the driver’s seating position. This 
information shall be in the English 
language and conform in color and 
format, not including the border 
surrounding the entire placard. 
V. Summary of Toyota’s Petition: The 
following views and arguments 
presented in this section, ‘‘V. Summary 
of Toyota’s Petition,’’ are the views and 
arguments provided by Toyota. They do 
not reflect the views of NHTSA. Toyota 
describes the subject noncompliance 
and contends that the noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety. 
Toyota explains that the tire 
information placard on the subject 
vehicles provides a vehicle weight 
capacity that is lower than the actual 
value. Therefore, Toyota says that 
vehicle owners referring to the incorrect 
vehicle capacity weight stated on the 
tire information placard are not at risk 
of overloading the subject vehicle 
beyond the vehicle capacity weight. The 
tire information placard states that the 
vehicle capacity weight for the subject 
vehicle is 925 pounds when it should 
state that the vehicle weight capacity is 
1,045 pounds. Toyota says that if a 
vehicle owner loads a subject vehicle 
according to the weight stated on the 
tire information placard, the subject 
vehicle would still have an additional 
120 pounds of weight capacity. 
Toyota contends that NHTSA has 
previously stated that the ‘‘intent of 
FMVSS No. 110 is to ensure that 
vehicles are equipped with tires 
appropriate to handle maximum vehicle 
loads and prevent overloading’’
1
and 
FMVSS No. 110 states that the purpose 
of the requirements for tire selection are 
to ‘‘prevent tire overloading.’’
2
 
Because the tire information placard 
contains a vehicle weight capacity that 
is lower than the actual weight capacity, 
Toyota says there is no risk of 
overloading if the vehicle owner loads 
the subject vehicle according to the 
incorrect value. Toyota adds that all 
other information on the tire 
information placard is accurate, and 
Toyota has corrected the subject 
noncompliance in current production of 
the subject vehicles. 
Furthermore, Toyota says that the 
owner’s manual states the correct 
vehicle capacity weight, and the tire 
information placard contains the text 
‘‘See Owner’s Manual for additional 
information.’’ 
Toyota says that NHTSA previously 
granted a petition submitted by 
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, (MBUSA) 
that involved a similar noncompliance.
3
 
In that case, the affected vehicles were 
affixed with a tire information placard 
that contained the incorrect maximum 
combined weight of occupants and 
cargo and, therefore, did not comply 
with the requirements of paragraph 
S4.3(a) of FMVSS No. 110. The tire 
information placard in the MBUSA 
vehicles contained a higher than 
intended value for the maximum 
combined weight of occupants and 
cargo; however, the tires and load 
carrying capabilities of the affected 
MBUSA vehicles exceeded the incorrect 
value identified by the tire information 
placard. Toyota says that NHTSA found

poses an unreasonable risk when it ‘‘results in 
hazards as potentially dangerous as sudden engine 
fire, and where there is no dispute that at least some 
such hazards, in this case fires, can definitely be 
expected to occur in the future’’). 
that the tire capacities of those vehicles 
were capable of safely handling the 
additional weight of the higher vehicle 
weight capacity that was provided 
without risk of overloading. 
Toyota contends that NHTSA should 
similarly find that the subject 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
motor vehicle safety because the tire 
information placard on the subject 
vehicles provides a vehicle weight 
capacity that is lower than intended. 
Due to this, Toyota believes that the 
subject noncompliance does not pose a 
risk of vehicle overloading because the 
vehicle and its tires can accommodate 
more than the incorrect vehicle capacity 
weight that is stated on the tire 
information placard. 
Toyota concludes by stating its belief 
that the subject noncompliance is 
inconsequential as it relates to motor 
vehicle safety and its petition to be 
exempted from providing notification of 
the noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30118, and a remedy for the 
noncompliance, as required by 49 
U.S.C. 30120, should be granted. 
VI. NHTSA’s Analysis: 
In determining inconsequentiality of a 
noncompliance, NHTSA focuses on the 
safety risk to individuals who 
experience the type of event against 
which a recall would otherwise 
protect.
4
In general, NHTSA does not 
consider the absence of complaints or 
injuries when determining if a 
noncompliance is inconsequential to 
safety. The absence of complaints does 
not mean vehicle occupants have not 
experienced a safety issue, nor does it 
mean that there will not be safety issues 
in the future.
5
Further, because each 
inconsequential noncompliance petition 
must be evaluated on its own facts and 
determinations are highly fact- 
dependent, NHTSA does not consider 
prior determinations as binding 
precedent. Petitioners are reminded that 
they have the burden of persuading 
NHTSA that the noncompliance is 
inconsequential to safety. 
FMVSS No. 110 specifies 
requirements for tire selection to 
prevent tire overload. The intent of the 
standard is to ensure that vehicles are 
equipped with tires appropriate to 
handle the vehicle manufacturer’s 
designed maximum vehicle weight. 
The maximum weight of a vehicle is 
determined by adding to the vehicle the 
manufacturer specified maximum 
weight of occupants and cargo. FMVSS 
No. 110, paragraph S4.3(a) requires that 
vehicles be labeled with a ‘‘Vehicle 
Capacity Weight (VCW)’’ value which is 
the specified maximum occupant and 
cargo weight that can be loaded into a 
vehicle. This value is equal to 68 kg 
times the vehicle’s designated seating 
capacity plus the rated cargo/payload of 
the vehicle. FMVSS No. 110, S4.2.1.1 
and S4.3.4(b), requires that the vehicle 
maximum load on the tire shall not be 
greater than the applicable maximum 
load rating as marked on the sidewall of 
the tire or greater than the load rating of 
the tire at the manufacturer specified 
cold inflation pressure listed on the tire 
and loading information placard. 
For the subject vehicles, Toyota noted 
that the vehicle weight capacity values 
on the placards are incorrect. The 
vehicle placard on the subject vehicles 
indicates that the vehicle weight 
capacity is 925 pounds when it should 
state that the vehicle weight capacity is 
1,045 pounds. These errors would not 
cause a consumer to load the subject 
vehicles beyond their original design 
specifications. 
Toyota cited prior NHTSA 
determinations of inconsequentiality 
petitions in support of the contention 
that the noncompliance involved here 
also had no safety impact. NHTSA notes 
that it evaluates each petition on its 
individual facts and does not consider 
prior determinations as binding 
precedent. 
VII. NHTSA’s Decision: In 
consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA 
finds that Toyota has met its burden of 
persuasion that the subject FMVSS No. 
110 noncompliance in the affected 
vehicles is inconsequential to motor 
vehicle safety. Accordingly, Toyota’s 
petition is hereby granted, and Toyota is 
consequently exempted from the 
obligation of providing notification of, 
and a free remedy for, that 
noncompliance under 49 U.S.C. 30118 
and 30120. 
NHTSA notes that the statutory 
provisions (49 U.S.C. 30118(d) and 
30120(h)) that permit manufacturers to 
file petitions for a determination of 
inconsequentiality allow NHTSA to 
exempt manufacturers only from the 
duties found in sections 30118 and 
30120, respectively, to notify owners, 
purchasers, and dealers of a defect or 
noncompliance and to remedy the 
defect or noncompliance. Therefore, this 
decision only applies to the subject 
vehicles that Toyota no longer 
controlled at the time it determined that 
the noncompliance existed. However, 
the granting of this petition does not 
relieve vehicles distributors and dealers 
of the prohibitions on the sale, offer for 
sale, or introduction or delivery for 
introduction into interstate commerce of 
the noncompliant vehicles under their 
control after Toyota notified them that 
the subject noncompliance existed.

that are intended by the parties to be 
cleared contemporaneously with 
execution, or subject to prime broker 
arrangements that meet certain 
qualifying conditions, and makes 
certain other changes discussed herein. 
The adopted amendments supersede 
certain no-action positions issued by the 
Commission’s Market Participants 
Division (‘‘MPD’’), which the 
Commission expects MPD to terminate 
in due course. 
DATES: The Final Rule is effective January 29, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Commission is issuing this Final 
Rule to amend certain business conduct 
standards for swap dealers (‘‘SDs’’) and 
major swap participants (‘‘MSPs’’ and, 
together with SDs, ‘‘Swap Entities’’)
1
 
contained in subpart H of part 23 of the 
Commission’s regulations,
2
and to the 
swap trading relationship 
documentation rule for Swap Entities in 
§ 23.504.
3
These amendments are 
intended to address certain long- 
standing issues with the Commission’s 
external business conduct standards and 
swap trading relationship 
documentation rule, and are intended to 
supersede many long-standing no-action 
positions issued by MPD (together, the 
‘‘Covered Staff Letters’’) by codifying 
such positions in the Commission’s 
regulations, as explained below.
4
The 
Commission has observed that MPD’s 
long-standing no-action positions set 
forth in the Covered Staff Letters appear 
to have addressed many of the issues 
raised by market participants and the 
Commission is not aware of any adverse 
consequences of such MPD no-action 
positions. Therefore, the Commission is 
amending the external business conduct 
standards and the swap trading 
relationship documentation rule to 
provide an outcome comparable to such 
no-action positions, with certain 
modifications discussed below. 
Together, the Covered Staff Letters 
provided no-action positions regarding 
compliance with certain external 
business conduct standards (including 
certain required pre-trade disclosures) 
and documentation requirements 
applicable to Swap Entities in the 
context of: (1) swaps executed pursuant 
to prime broker arrangements between 
SDs acting as prime brokers and their 
customers; and (2) swaps executed by 
Swap Entities with counterparties 
where the parties to the swap intend the 
swap to be cleared contemporaneously 
with execution of such swap. The 
Commission expects that, in due course, 
MPD will withdraw all of the no-action 
positions contained in the Covered Staff 
Letters necessary to reflect the 
amendments to Commission 
Regulations made by this Final Rule.
5
 
A. Applicable Regulatory Requirements 
Section 4s(h) of the CEA
6
provides 
the Commission with both mandatory 
and discretionary rulemaking authority 
to impose business conduct standards 
on Swap Entities in their dealings with 
counterparties, including Special 
Entities.
7
Pursuant to this rulemaking 
authority, the Commission adopted 
rules in subpart H of part 23 of its 
regulations, which set forth business 
conduct standards for Swap Entities in 
their dealings with counterparties (the 
‘‘External Business Conduct 
Standards’’).
8
 
The External Business Conduct 
Standards include certain pre-trade 
disclosures required to be made by 
Swap Entities to their counterparties 
that are not Swap Entities, security- 
based swap dealers, or security-based 
major swap participants, including a 
requirement under § 23.431(a)(3)(i) to 
disclose the price of the swap and the 
so-called ‘‘pre-trade mid-market mark’’ 
(the ‘‘PTMMM’’; and such disclosure 
requirement, the ‘‘PTMMM 
Requirement’’).

The PTMMM was 
intended to be the mid-market mark of 
the swap, not including any amount 
added by the Swap Entity for profit, 
credit reserve, hedging, funding, 
liquidity, or any other costs or 
adjustments.

7 U.S.C. 7a–1. 
The External Business Conduct 
Standards also include a requirement 
under § 23.431(b) that an SD must 
provide counterparties that are not 
Swap Entities, security-based swap 
dealers, or security-based major swap 
participants with notice that the 
counterparty may request and consult 
on the design of a scenario analysis to 
allow the counterparty to assess its 
potential exposure in connection with a 
swap (the ‘‘Scenario Analysis 
Requirement’’).
11
The scenario analysis, 
if requested, was required to (1) be 
completed over a range of assumptions, 
including severe downside stress 
scenarios that would result in 
significant loss; (2) disclose all non- 
proprietary material assumptions and 
calculation methodologies; and (3) 
consider any relevant analysis that an 
SD undertakes for its own risk 
management purposes.
12
 
Section 4s(i) of the CEA requires the 
Commission to adopt rules governing 
swap documentation for Swap 
Entities.
13
Pursuant to this rulemaking 
authority, the Commission adopted 
rules in subpart I of part 23 of its 
regulations.
14
These include § 23.504, 
which mandates that Swap Entities 
enter into swap trading relationship 
documentation (‘‘STRD’’) meeting the 
requirements of the rule with 
counterparties prior to execution of a 
swap (the ‘‘STRD Requirement’’).
15
 
B. Staff No-Action Positions 
1. Intended To Be Cleared Swaps 
In 2013, MPD issued CFTC Staff 
Letter 13–70
16
following a request to 
provide a no-action position with 
respect to compliance with certain 
External Business Conduct Standards 
and the STRD Requirement in the 
context of swaps executed by SDs with 
counterparties where the parties to the 
swap intend to clear the swap 
contemporaneously with execution 
(such swaps are herein referred to as 
‘‘Intended To Be Cleared Swaps’’ or 
‘‘ITBC Swaps’’). In support of their 
request, market participants informed 
staff that the External Business Conduct 
Standards and the STRD Requirement 
significantly hindered the efficient 
execution and processing of swaps that 
were intended to be cleared (i.e., so- called ‘‘straight-through-processing’’) 
and that compliance with such 
regulatory requirements was 
unnecessary to achieve the 
Commission’s regulatory goals. Market 
participants generally argued that: (1) 
because swaps of a type accepted for 
clearing by a derivatives clearing 
organization (‘‘DCO’’)
17
are sufficiently 
standardized, (especially if also 
executed on a designated contract 
market (‘‘DCM’’)
18
or swap execution 
facility (‘‘SEF’’)),
19
and information 
about the risks and characteristics of 
such swaps is available from the DCO 
(or the DCM or SEF if executed there), 
the benefits of compliance by an SD 
with the disclosure and suitability 
requirements of the External Business 
Conduct Standards are to a large extent 
moot; and (2) because swaps, once 
cleared, are between the DCO and the 
market participant (not between the SD 
and its counterparty), there is no 
ongoing trading relationship between 
the SD and its counterparty with respect 
to such swaps, and thus there is no need 
for the SD to comply with the on- 
boarding requirements of the External 
Business Conduct Standards or the 
STRD Requirement.
20
 
In addition, in 2022, MPD recognized 
that the Commission had exempted a 
number of non-U.S. central clearing 
counterparties from registration as a 
DCO and a number of non-U.S. trading 
facilities from registration as a SEF. 
Specifically, section 5b(h) of the CEA 
authorizes the Commission to exempt, 
conditionally or unconditionally, a DCO 
from registration, if the Commission 
finds that the DCO is ‘‘subject to 
comparable, comprehensive supervision 
and regulation by . . . the appropriate 
government authorities in the home 
country of the organization.’’
21
To date, 
the Commission has issued exemptions 
from registration to four DCOs: ASX 
Clear (Futures) Pty Limited (‘‘ASX’’);
22
 
Japan Securities Clearing Corporation 
(‘‘JSCC’’);
23
Korea Exchange, Inc. 
(‘‘KRX’’);
24
OTC Clearing Hong Kong 
Limited (‘‘OTC Clear’’),
25
and Taiwan 
Futures Exchange Corporation 
(‘‘TAIFEX’’).
26
Any DCO that, as of any 
date of determination, is exempt from 
registration as a DCO under section 5b 
of the CEA,
27
including, without 
limitation, ASX, JSCC, KRX, OTC Clear 
and TAIFEX, is an ‘‘Exempt DCO’’ on 
such date for purposes of this Final 
Rule. 
Similarly, section 5h(g) of the CEA 
authorizes the Commission to exempt, 
conditionally or unconditionally, a SEF 
from registration, if the Commission

29
On December 8, 2017, the Commission issued 
an Order of Exemption with respect to multilateral 
trading facilities (‘‘MTFs’’) and organised trading 
facilities (‘‘OTFs’’) authorized in the European 
Union (‘‘EU’’) (the ‘‘EU Exemptive Order’’). See EU Exemptive Order, as most recently amended by the 
Third Amendment to Appendix A to Order of 
Exemption (October 26, 2022), available at https:// 
www.cftc.gov/media/7896/EuropeanUnionThird
AmendmentAppendixA_CEASection5hgOrder/ download. 
The EU Exemptive Order exempts each of the 
MTFs and OTFs listed in Appendix A thereto, as 
such Appendix A may be amended by the 
Commission from time to time (the ‘‘Exempt EU 
Trading Venues’’), from registration with the 
Commission as a SEF. In response to the 
withdrawal of the United Kingdom (‘‘UK’’) from the 
EU, commonly referred to as ‘‘Brexit,’’ CFTC staff 
from the Division of Market Oversight (‘‘DMO’’) 
issued a no-action position addressing certain UK 
MTFs and OTFs that had previously benefitted from 
the EU Exemptive Order (‘‘UK NAL Exchanges’’). 
Under this no-action position, UK NAL Exchanges 
may operate on much the same basis as an Exempt 
EU Trading Venue, subject to the terms of the letter, 
without DMO recommending that the Commission 
take an enforcement action against them for failure 
to register with the CFTC as a SEF. See, most recently, CFTC Staff Letter No. 24–11 (Aug. 28, 
2024), available at https://www.cftc.gov/csl/24-11/ download. The Commission expects that MPD will issue a no-action position for ITBC Swaps on UK 
NAL Exchanges after the publication of this Final 
Rule. 
30
On March 13, 2019, the Commission issued an 
Order of Exemption with respect to approved 
exchanges (‘‘AEs’’) and recognized market operators 
(‘‘RMOs’’) authorized in Singapore (the ‘‘SG 
Exemptive Order,’’ available at https://
www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/Singapore
CEASection5hgOrder.pdf), as most recently amended by the ‘‘Third Amendment to Appendix 
A to Order of Exemption,’’ dated July 31, 2024 
(available at https://www.cftc.gov/media/11046/ 
SingaporeThirdAmendmentAppendixA_CEASection5hgOrder/download). 
The SG Exemptive Order exempts each of the AEs 
and RMOs listed in Appendix A thereto, as such 
Appendix A may be amended by the Commission 
from time to time (the ‘‘Exempt SG Trading 
Venues’’), from registration with the Commission as 
a SEF. 
31
On July 11, 2019, the Commission issued an 
Order of Exemption with respect to electronic 
trading platforms (‘‘ETPs’’) registered in Japan (the 
‘‘Japan Exemptive Order’’ and, together with the EU 
Exemptive Order and the SG Exemptive Order, the 
‘‘SEF Exemptive Orders,’’) available at https://
www.cftc.gov/media/2216/JapaneseCEASection
5hgOrder/download. 
The Japan Exemptive Order exempts each ETP 
listed in Appendix A thereto, as such Appendix A 
may be amended by the Commission from time to 
time (the ‘‘Exempt Japan Trading Venues’’), from 
registration with the Commission as a SEF.

See, e.g., 17 CFR 40.2(a)(3), which requires a 
SEF seeking to list a new product to provide an 
explanation and analysis of the new product and 
the product’s terms and conditions. 
36
See, e.g., 17 CFR 39.5(b), which requires a DCO 
seeking to clear a new type of swap to provide 
information on the outstanding notional exposures, 
trading liquidity, and adequate pricing data, as well 
as product specifications, legal documentation, 
contract terms, and standard practices for managing 
life cycle events.

Such compliance difficulties were not wholly 
unanticipated. See Further Definition of ‘‘Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Security-Based Swap Dealer,’’ ‘‘Major

finds that the facility is ‘‘subject to 
comparable, comprehensive supervision 
and regulation on a consolidated basis 
by . . . the appropriate governmental 
authorities in the home country of the 
facility.’’
28
To date, the Commission has 
issued exemptions from SEF registration 
to facilities for the trading or processing 
of swaps from the European Union,
29
 
Singapore,
30
and Japan.
31
Any facilities 
for the trading or processing of swaps 
that, as of any date of determination, are 
exempt from registration as a SEF under 
section 5h(g) of the CEA,
32
including, 
without limitation, any Exempt EU 
Trading Venue, Exempt SG Trading 
Venue, or Exempt Japan Trading Venue 
is an ‘‘Exempt SEF’’ on such date for 
purposes of this Final Rule. 
Because Swap Entities that are 
otherwise subject to the Commission’s 
External Business Conduct Standards 
and documentation requirements are 
free to execute swaps on Exempt SEFs 
and clear swaps on Exempt DCOs 
pursuant to, and subject to the 
conditions of, the foregoing Commission 
actions, MPD recognized that execution 
by Swap Entities of ITBC Swaps on an 
Exempt SEF and/or clearing of such 
ITBC Swaps on an Exempt DCO should 
be treated the same as swaps executed 
on DCMs or SEFs and/or cleared on 
DCOs. Consequently, MPD issued CFTC 
Staff Letter 23–01, which superseded 
CFTC Staff Letter 13–70 in its entirety.
33
 
CFTC Staff Letter 23–01 provided a 
revised MPD no-action position, which 
incorporates, expands on, and refines 
the MPD no-action position presented in 
CFTC Staff Letter 13–70 with regard to 
compliance with certain External 
Business Conduct Standards by Swap 
Entities, and clarifies its no-action 
position regarding documentation 
requirements under the STRD 
Requirement.
34
 
The Commission has determined that 
the standardization that occurs when a 
type of swap is made available to trade 
on a DCM, SEF
35
or Exempt SEF and/ 
or accepted for clearing on a DCO
36
or 
Exempt DCO generally entails a material 
increase in the amount of information 
that is available about that type of swap. 
Prices, daily marks, and volume 
information become available and 
therefore market participants are able to 
research and track how such swaps 
respond to changing market conditions, 
providing insight into the risks and 
characteristics of a particular type of 
swap for non-swap entity counterparties 
to evaluate independently. The 
standardization may also allow parties 
to transact in smaller or larger notional 
amounts to suit their needs than may be 
available for an uncleared swap and to 
more easily find willing counterparties 
if they need to increase, decrease, or exit 
a certain position. Due to the 
standardization and concomitant 
increase in the information available 
and additional trade management 
flexibility, the Commission has 
determined that the public policy goals 
of the disclosure and suitability 
requirements of the External Business 
Conduct Standards have been met by 
other means, and thus compliance by a 
Swap Entity with the disclosure and 
suitability requirements are unnecessary 
for ITBC Swaps. Further, the 
Commission has determined that 
compliance with such requirements 
may represent a significant hinderance 
to the efficient trading of cleared swaps. 
The Commission has also determined 
that because swaps, once cleared, are 
between the DCO and the market 
participant (not between the Swap 
Entity and its counterparty) and there is 
no ongoing trading relationship between 
the Swap Entity and its counterparty, 
compliance by a Swap Entity with the 
on-boarding requirements of the 
External Business Conduct Standards or 
the STRD Requirement represents a 
significant hinderance to the efficient 
trading of cleared swaps. 
2. Prime Broker Arrangements 
In 2013, MPD recognized that 
execution of swaps pursuant to long- 
standing conditions present in swap 
prime broker arrangements prevalent in 
the swap market made compliance with 
certain requirements under the External 
Business Conduct Standards by SDs 
operating as prime brokers (‘‘PBs’’) 
impossible due to the structure and 
information flows of these 
arrangements.
37
 
PBs engaging in these swaps provide 
credit intermediation for their PB 
customers while permitting such 
customers to solicit prices from a wide 
variety of swap market participants. The 
PB customer agrees on a price and other 
material economic terms of a swap with 
a potential swap counterparty, but the 
swap is actually executed at that price 
and on those terms between the PB and

39
Pursuant to section 1a(47)(E) of the CEA, the 
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury (‘‘Secretary’’) was 
vested with the authority to determine whether 
foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange 
forwards should be regulated as swaps under the 
CEA, provided that the Secretary made a written 
determination satisfying certain criteria specified in 
section 1b of the CEA. See 7 U.S.C. 1a(47)(E) (citing 7 U.S.C. 1b). On November 16, 2012, the Secretary 
issued a written determination that foreign 
exchange swaps and forwards should not be 
regulated as swaps as defined under the CEA. See U.S. Treasury Determination of Foreign Exchange 
Swaps and Foreign Exchange Forwards Under the 
Commodity Exchange Act, 77 FR 69694 (Nov. 20, 
2012) (‘‘Treasury Determination’’). See also CFTC 
Staff Letter 25–10 (Apr. 9, 2025), Re: Staff 
Interpretation Regarding Certain Foreign Exchange 
Products. 
The term ‘‘covered transaction’’ means a swap, as 
defined in section 1(a)(47) of the CEA and § 1.3, 
other than swaps subject to the clearing 
requirement of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the CEA and 
part 50 of the Commission’s regulations, and 
physically-settled foreign exchange forwards and 
swap agreements that have been exempted from the 
definition of swap under the Treasury 
Determination. See CFTC Staff Letter 13–11 and Treasury Determination. 
40
See CFTC Staff Letter 13–11. 41
Id. at 6–10. 42
In CFTC Staff Letter 13–11, ‘‘Exempt FX 
Transactions’’ are defined as physically-settled 
foreign exchange forwards and swap agreements 
that have been exempted from the definition of 
swap by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Id. (citing Treasury Determination). 
43
Notwithstanding the Treasury Determination, 
section 1a(47)(E)(iv) of the CEA provides that ‘‘any 
party to a foreign exchange swap or forward that is 
a swap dealer or major swap participant shall 
conform to the business conduct standards 
contained in section 4s(h) [of the CEA].’’ 7 U.S.C. 
1a(47)(E)(iv). Thus, Swap Entities are required to 
comply with the External Business Conduct 
Standards with respect to Exempt FX Transactions. 
44
See CFTC Staff Letter 13–11 at 10 (stating that no-action position is only applicable with respect

Pre-Trade Mid-Market Mark for Certain Foreign 
Exchange Transactions. 
the counterparty chosen by the PB’s 
customer (the ‘‘trigger swap’’). The PB, 
in turn, then enters into a matching 
swap with its customer (the ‘‘mirror 
swap’’). Thus, the customer has the 
advantage of seeking favorable prices 
and terms while maintaining a credit 
relationship with only its PB, 
simplifying its operations and benefiting 
from collateral netting. The PB enters 
into two equal but opposite swaps and 
thus all but eliminates its market risk 
and has only credit risk to its customer 
and the trigger swap counterparty (i.e., 
credit intermediation). 
However, because the PB arrangement 
permits the PB customer to seek prices 
from various counterparties, the PB 
cannot know the price or the exact 
terms of the swap before the PB is 
obligated to execute both the trigger 
swap and the mirror swap. This lack of 
information may prevent a PB that is an 
SD from complying with certain pre- 
trade regulatory obligations under the 
External Business Conduct Standards, 
most notably the pre-trade disclosure of 
the price, material economic terms, and 
a PTMMM of the swaps as required by 
§ 23.431(a)(3).
38
 
Recognizing these structural and 
informational hurdles to compliance 
with the External Business Conduct 
Standards, MPD issued a no-action 
position in CFTC Staff Letter 13–11 with 
respect to the enumerated External 
Business Conduct Standards as they 
relate to certain covered transactions
39
 
executed under PB arrangements where 
the PB and trigger swap counterparty 
were each SDs registered with the 
Commission.
40
Specifically, MPD stated 
that it would not recommend an 
enforcement action against such SDs if 
the PB allocated its responsibilities 
under the relevant External Business 
Conduct Standards to the SD that is the 
trigger swap counterparty, subject to 
certain other conditions provided in 
CFTC Staff Letter 13–11.
41
 
In addition, MPD recognized that 
many trigger swap counterparties 
transacting in the market for foreign 
exchange swaps and forwards that were 
exempted from the swap definition 
pursuant to the Treasury Determination 
(‘‘Exempt FX Transactions’’)
42
were not 
SDs. Although such transactions are 
exempted from the swap definition, SDs 
executing Exempt FX Transactions 
remain obligated to comply with the 
External Business Conduct Standards.
43
 
However, where the trigger swap 
counterparty is not an SD, such 
counterparty could not meet the 
conditions of CFTC Staff Letter 13–11 
regarding allocation of certain External 
Business Conduct Standards between 
SDs. Thus, CFTC Staff Letter 13–11 
presented a more straightforward and 
limited no-action position with respect 
to Exempt FX Transactions executed 
under a PB arrangement where the PB 
is a registered SD and the trigger swap 
counterparty is not registered with the 
Commission as an SD, providing a no- 
action position only with respect to a 
failure to comply with the disclosure 
requirements of §§ 23.431(a)(3)(i) and 
23.431(b).
44
 
Finally, in 2019, MPD recognized that 
certain PB transactions executed 
anonymously on SEFs raised additional 
structural and informational hurdles to 
compliance with the disclosure 
requirements of §§ 23.431(a) and (b)
45
 
in the context of PB arrangements. 
Commission regulation 23.431(c) 
provides that §§ 23.431(a) and (b) do not 
apply to swaps executed by an SD on a 
SEF where the SD does not know the 
identity of its counterparty prior to 
execution.
46
In the PB context, this 
exception from the disclosure 
requirements of §§ 23.431(a) and (b) 
would apply to the trigger swap 
between the SD acting as a PB (a ‘‘PB/ 
SD’’) and the trigger swap counterparty 
that is executed anonymously on a SEF, 
but the mirror swap between the PB/SD 
and its PB customer would not be 
executed anonymously or on a SEF, and 
thus would not qualify for the 
exemption. However, the price and 
other material economic terms of the 
mirror swap are determined based on 
those of the trigger swap executed on 
the SEF, and therefore, it would be 
impossible for the PB/SD to provide the 
disclosures required by §§ 23.431(a) and 
(b) to its PB customer prior to being 
obligated to enter into the mirror swap. 
Recognizing this structural obstacle to 
compliance with §§ 23.431(a) and (b), 
MPD provided a no-action position in 
CFTC Staff Letter 19–06 stating that it 
would not recommend an enforcement 
action against a PB/SD for failure to 
make the disclosures required by 
§§ 23.431(a) and (b) to its customer in 
relation to the mirror swap where the 
trigger swap is executed anonymously 
on a SEF.
47
 
The Commission has determined that 
PB arrangements common in the swaps 
and Exempt FX Transaction markets 
prior to promulgation of the External 
Business Conduct Standards present 
significant structural and informational 
hurdles to compliance with the 
disclosure requirements of §§ 23.431(a) 
and (b).
48
The Commission has also 
observed that the long-standing MPD 
no-action position set forth in CFTC 
Staff Letter 13–11 (as extended to off- 
SEF swaps in CFTC Staff Letter 19–06) 
appears to have sufficiently addressed 
these significant structural and 
informational hurdles to compliance 
with the disclosure requirements of 
§§ 23.431(a) and (b),
49
and, to the 
Commission’s knowledge, has not 
resulted in any adverse consequences. 
3. Pre-Trade Mid-Market Mark No- 
Action Positions 
In 2013, MPD provided a no-action 
position in CFTC Staff Letter 13–12 
(which was a revision of CFTC Staff 
Letter 12–42)
50
stating that it would not 
recommend enforcement action against 
a Swap Entity for its failure to disclose 
an otherwise required PTMMM to a

counterparty so long as the transaction 
was a foreign exchange swap, foreign 
exchange forward, or vanilla foreign 
exchange option of six-months or less 
that is physically settled, where: (1) 
each currency is one of the ‘‘BIS 31 
Currencies’’ (i.e., a specified, widely- traded currency);
51
(2) real-time 
tradeable bid and offer prices for the 
transaction are available electronically 
to the counterparty; and (3) the 
counterparty agrees in advance that the 
Swap Entity need not disclose the 
PTMMM.
52
CFTC Staff Letter 13–12 also 
provided a no-action position regarding 
the disclosure of a PTMMM for Exempt 
FX Transactions entered into by Swap 
Entities anonymously on electronic 
trading facilities that are not registered 
with the Commission as SEFs or DCMs, 
reasoning that because Exempt FX 
Transactions are not swaps per the 
Treasury Determination, such 
transactions need not be executed on 
SEFs or DCMs, but should be treated the 
same as swaps executed on SEFs or 
DCMs.
53
Swaps executed anonymously 
on a SEF or DCM are excepted from the 
requirement to disclose a PTMMM 
pursuant to § 23.431(c).
54
 
MPD provided a substantially similar 
no-action position in CFTC Staff Letter 
12–58, stating that it would not 
recommend enforcement action against 
a Swap Entity for failure to disclose a 
PTMMM for certain widely-traded 
interest rate swaps or index credit 
default swaps,
55
provided that real-time 
tradeable bid and offer prices for the 
relevant swap are available 
electronically to the counterparty on a 
DCM or SEF, and the counterparty 
agrees in advance that the Swap Entity 
need not disclose the PTMMM.
56
 
Finally, MPD provided a no-action 
position in CFTC Staff Letter 25–09, 
stating that it would not recommend 
that the Commission commence an 
enforcement action against a Swap 
Entity for failure to satisfy the PTMMM 
Requirement for its non-Swap Entity 
counterparties. MPD issued CFTC Staff 
Letter 25–09 in response to a request 
from certain trade associations 
representing a wide breadth of swap 
market participants who argued that: (1) 
the PTMMM Requirement does not 
provide any significant informational 
value to a Swap Entity’s counterparties; 
(2) the PTMMM Requirement imposes 
significant operational burdens on Swap 
Entities and, at worst, impedes the 
prompt execution of swaps transactions; 
and (3) the elimination of the PTMMM 
Requirement would further harmonize 
the Commission’s regulations with those 
of the United States (‘‘U.S.’’) Securities 
and Exchange Commission (‘‘SEC’’) 
applicable to security-based swap 
dealers and major security-based swap 
participants, which do not require 
disclosure of a PTMMM in relation to 
security-based swaps. CFTC Staff Letter 
25–09 stated that it would remain in 
effect until the adoption by the 
Commission of a regulation addressing 
the PTMMM Requirement. This Final 
Rule addresses the PTMMM 
Requirement. 
II. Summary of the Proposal and 
Comments Received 
On September 30, 2025, the 
Commission approved and subsequently 
published in the Federal Register a 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (the 
‘‘Proposal’’ or ‘‘Proposed Rule’’)
57
 
proposing amendments to the External 
Business Conduct Standards and the 
STRD Requirement to provide 
exceptions to compliance with such 
requirements when executing swaps 
that are: (1) ITBC Swaps; or (2) subject 
to prime broker arrangements that meet 
certain qualifying conditions. The 
Proposal also proposed certain other 
changes discussed herein, including 
eliminating the PTMMM Requirement 
and the Scenario Analysis Requirement, 
and proposed a simplifying amendment 
to replace each reference in the External 
Business Conduct Standards to ‘‘swap 
dealer and major swap participant’’ with 
a reference to ‘‘swap entity,’’ as defined 
in § 23.401
58
to mean ‘‘a swap dealer or 
major swap participant.’’ 
The Commission requested comments 
on all aspects of the Proposed Rule and 
on many specific questions listed in the 
Proposal. The comment period for the 
Proposal closed on November 14, 
2025.
59
The Commission received a 
total of four comment letters, all of 
which were relevant to the Proposal.
60
 
All of these letters supported the 
Proposal broadly but only the ISDA/ 
SIFMA Letter and the Citadel Letter 
suggested specific changes to portions of 
the Proposal, which are discussed in the 
relevant sections below. 
A. Pre-Trade Mid-Market Mark 
Disclosure Requirement 
As discussed above, Commission 
Regulation § 23.431(a)(3)(i) currently 
requires pre-trade disclosures by Swap 
Entities to their counterparties that are 
not Swap Entities, security-based swap 
dealers, or security-based major swap 
participants, including the PTMMM. 
1. Proposal 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
proposed to eliminate the Swap Entity 
PTMMM Requirement set forth in 
§ 23.431(a)(3)(i)
61
in its entirety. The 
Commission cited several reasons for 
proposing this change based on its 
experience since 2013 when it first 
required Swap Entity compliance with 
the External Business Conduct 
Standards. First, although the 
Commission believed that the PTMMM 
Requirement would provide 
counterparties with ‘‘pricing 
information that facilitates negotiations 
and balances historical information 
asymmetry regarding swap pricing,’’
62
 
it received suggestions from several 
commenters, in their responses to a 
request for comments and 
recommendations under the 
Commission’s ‘‘Project KISS’’ in 2017,
63
 
requesting that the Commission 
eliminate or revise the PTMMM 
Requirement, arguing that, among other 
things, the requirement: (1) creates

unnecessary burdens and costs; (2) is of 
minimal to no utility to counterparties; 
(3) hampers trading flow by delaying 
execution; (4) creates confusion; and (5) 
is unnecessary for counterparties 
because such counterparties must be 
eligible contract participants 
(‘‘ECPs’’),
64
which are deemed 
sufficiently sophisticated to enter into 
over-the-counter swaps.
65
 
Second, MPD’s issuance of the no- 
action positions in the Covered Staff 
Letters show that the PTMMM 
Requirement has been unworkable in a 
wide variety of contexts in which 
uncleared swaps are executed between 
Swap Entities and their non-Swap 
Entity counterparties. This includes 
swaps executed pursuant to PB 
arrangements where a PB that is an SD 
does not know the price or other 
material economic terms of a swap until 
after it is obligated to enter into the 
swap. It also includes, as discussed 
above, ITBC Swaps where the Swap 
Entities do not know the identity of 
their counterparty prior to execution, 
and widely-traded, highly-liquid swaps 
where the disclosure of a PTMMM is 
redundant because bid/offer prices are 
readily available to potential 
counterparties from trading and price 
information platforms.
66
Additionally, 
MPD has provided a no-action position 
regarding the disclosure of PTMMMs in 
the context of the LIBOR transition 
(swaps needing amendment to switch 
reference rates away from LIBOR) where 
the PTMMM Requirement applies, but 
is not relevant to the subject matter of 
the swap amendment.
67
 
In light of these circumstances, the 
Commission noted its preliminary belief 
in the Proposal that the PTMMM 
Requirement provides no utility to 
counterparties and may delay execution 
to the disadvantage of counterparties, 
and that the elimination of the PTMMM 
Requirement supports the Commission’s 
goal of increasing the efficiency of the 
swaps market. 
In addition to the foregoing, the 
Commission noted in the Proposal that 
the PTMMM Requirement, unlike the 
uncleared swap daily mark disclosure 
requirement promulgated in 
§ 23.431(d)(2),
68
was not required by the 
amendments to the CEA contained in 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (‘‘Dodd-Frank 
Act’’).
69
Thus, elimination of the 
PTMMM disclosure requirement would 
not contradict any counterparty 
protection otherwise required by the 
Dodd-Frank Act. Further, the 
Commission noted that elimination of 
the PTMMM disclosure requirement 
would serve to harmonize the 
Commission’s rules governing swap 
dealing with those of the SEC because 
the SEC does not require security-based 
swap dealers or security-based major 
swap participants to provide a PTMMM 
when entering into security-based 
swaps.
70
 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
Only the ISDA/SIFMA Letter 
specifically addressed the proposed 
elimination of the PTMMM 
Requirement. It supported elimination 
unequivocally, agreeing with the 
Commission’s reasoning for elimination 
in the Proposal, and noting that the 
PTMMM Requirement presumes an 
imbalance of information that does not 
exist in practice. After considering this 
comment, and having received no 
comments in support of the positive 
utility of receiving a PTMMM, the 
Commission has determined that 
elimination of the PTMMM 
Requirement will support the 
Commission’s goal of increasing the 
efficiency of the swaps market by: (1) 
reducing unnecessary burdens and cost, 
(2) allowing for more timely trade 
execution, and (3) harmonizing the 
Commission’s rules governing swap 
dealing with those of the SEC. Thus, the 
Commission is eliminating the PTMMM 
Requirement in its entirety as proposed 
by deleting paragraphs (i) and (ii) of 
§ 23.431(a)(3) and moving the price 
disclosure requirement currently in 
such paragraph (i) and the 
compensation disclosure requirement 
currently in such paragraph (ii) into 
paragraphs (2) and (3) of § 23.431(a), 
respectively, as reflected in the final 
rule text infra. 
The Commission notes that its repeal 
of the PTMMM Requirement herein 
renders the MPD no-action positions in 
CFTC Staff Letters 12–58, 13–12, and 
25–09 moot; it therefore expects that 
MPD will withdraw such positions in 
due course. 
B. Scenario Analysis Requirement 
As discussed above, § 23.431(b) 
currently requires Swap Entities to 
provide certain disclosures related to 
scenario analysis prior to entering into 
a swap with a counterparty (other than 
a swap dealer, major swap participant, 
security-based swap dealer, or major 
security-based swap participant) that is 
not made available for trading on a DCM 
or SEF. Such disclosures include that a 
Swap Entity must (1) notify the 
counterparty that it can request and 
consult on the design of a scenario 
analysis to allow the counterparty to 
assess its potential exposure in 
connection with the swap; (2) upon 
request of the counterparty, provide a 
scenario analysis, which is designed in 
consultation with the counterparty and 
done over a range of assumptions, 
including severe downside stress 
scenarios that would result in a 
significant loss; (3) disclose all material 
assumptions and explain the calculation 
methodologies used to perform any 
requested scenario analysis (a swap 
dealer, however, is not required to 
disclose confidential, proprietary 
information about any model it may use 
to prepare the scenario analysis); and (4) 
in designing any requested scenario 
analysis, consider any relevant analyses 
that the swap dealer undertakes for its 
own risk management purposes, 
including analyses performed as part of 
its ‘‘New Product Policy’’ specified in 
§ 23.600(c)(3). 
1. Proposal 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
proposed to eliminate the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement set forth in 
§ 23.431(b)
71
in its entirety based on its 
experience over the last decade since 
Swap Entity compliance with the 
External Business Conduct Standards 
was required, noting its belief that it 
provides no utility to counterparties. 
In adopting the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement in 2012, the Commission 
believed the requirement would assist to 
‘‘materially enhance the ability of 
counterparties to assess the merits of 
entering into any particular swap 
transaction and reduce information 
asymmetries between swap dealers . . . 
and their counterparties.’’
72
However, 
the Commission learned from several 
market participants, in responding to a 
request for comments and

recommendations under the 
Commission’s ‘‘Project KISS’’ in 2017,
73
 
that the current requirement provides 
little to no utility to counterparties, goes 
beyond typical risk disclosures, and 
incorporates extremely complex and 
subjective judgments about the probable 
or possible future market states and 
their relevance to a particular 
transaction and thus advocated that the 
Commission eliminate the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement or restrict the 
availability of scenario analysis.
74
 
In the Proposal, the Commission also 
stated that elimination of the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement would serve to 
harmonize the Commission’s rules 
governing swap dealing with those of 
the SEC noting that the SEC does not 
require security-based swap dealers to 
provide a scenario analysis, by request 
or otherwise, when entering into 
security-based swaps. Further, the 
Commission noted that scenario 
analysis was not required by the 
amendments to the CEA made by the 
Dodd-Frank Act and thus was wholly 
the product of Commission 
rulemaking.
75
 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
Only the ISDA/SIFMA Letter 
specifically addressed the proposed 
elimination of the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement.
76
It supported elimination 
unequivocally, agreeing with the 
Commission’s reasoning for elimination 
in the Proposal, noting that it is 
extremely rare for scenario analysis to 
be requested and stating the 
associations’ view that scenario analysis 
is of little utility to buy-side 
counterparties.
77
Having considered this 
comment and having received no 
comments opposed to the elimination of 
the Scenario Analysis Requirement, the 
Commission agrees with commenters 
that the Scenario Analysis Requirement 
has proven to have little utility to 
counterparties. Thus, the Commission is 
adopting the elimination of the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement as proposed by 
replacing paragraph (b) of § 23.431 with 
‘‘[RESERVED],’’ as reflected in the final 
rule text infra. 
C. Daily Mark Disclosure Requirement 
Section 4s(h)(3)(B) of the CEA 
required the Commission to adopt 
disclosure requirements for Swap 
Entities, including a requirement that a 
Swap Entity disclose a daily mark for 
uncleared swaps entered into with non- 
Swap Entities, but did not define the 
term ‘‘daily mark’’ or describe how it 
was to be calculated.
78
Thus, the 
Commission promulgated § 23.431(d)(2), 
which currently describes the daily 
mark as the ‘‘mid-market mark of the 
swap [not including] amounts for profit, 
credit reserve, hedging, funding, 
liquidity, or any other costs or 
adjustments.’’
79
The STRD Requirement 
in § 23.504 also requires Swap Entities 
to agree in writing with counterparties 
that are also Swap Entities or financial 
entities (as defined in § 23.500(e))
80
 
regarding the process for determining 
the value of each swap at any time from 
the execution to the termination, 
maturity, or expiration of the swap.
81
 
However, although the swap data 
reporting rules in part 45 of the 
Commission’s regulations define 
‘‘valuation data’’ by cross-referencing 
§ 23.431,
82
appendix 1 to part 45 defines 
‘‘valuation amount’’ (one of several 
elements that make up ‘‘valuation data’’) 
to mean the ‘‘[c]urrent value of the 
outstanding contract. Valuation amount 
is expressed as the exit cost of the 
contract or components of the contract, 
i.e., the price that would be received to sell the contract (in the market in an 
orderly transaction at the valuation 
date).’’
83
Commission regulation 
45.4(c)(2)(i) requires current valuation 
data for each outstanding swap to be 
reported to a swap data repository each 
business day.
84
 
In contrast, the Commission’s 
uncleared margin rules
85
require Swap 
Entities to calculate and to collect or 
post variation margin from or to 
counterparties that are Swap Entities or 
financial entities each business day.
86
 
‘‘Variation margin’’ is defined in 
§ 23.151 to mean collateral provided by 
a party to its counterparty to meet the 
performance of its obligation under one 
or more uncleared swaps between the 
parties as a result of a change in value 
of such obligations since the trade was 
executed or the last time such collateral 
was provided,
87
whereas the ‘‘variation 
margin amount’’ is defined in § 23.151 
as the cumulative mark-to-market 
change in value to a covered swap entity 
of an uncleared swap, as measured from 
the date it is entered into (or in the case 
of an uncleared swap that has a positive 
or negative value to a covered swap 
entity on the date it is entered into, such 
positive or negative value plus any 
cumulative mark-to-market change in 
value to the covered swap entity of an 
uncleared swap after such date), less the 
value of all variation margin previously 
collected, plus the value of all variation 
margin previously posted with respect 
to such uncleared swap.
88
Swap Entities 
are required to calculate the variation 
margin amount each business day 
pursuant to § 23.155 using methods, 
procedures, rules, and inputs that, to the 
maximum extent practicable, rely on 
recently-executed transactions, 
valuations provided by independent 
third parties, or other objective 
criteria.
89
Such methods are required to 
be documented in margin 
documentation required by § 23.158.
90
 
Thus, based on the foregoing, on any 
business day, a Swap Entity may be 
required to calculate the valuation of a 
swap for three different purposes using 
three similar but not identical criteria 
for purposes of: (1) providing the daily 
mark of the swap to its counterparty 
under § 23.431(d)(2); (2) reporting 
valuation data for the swap to a swap 
data repository under § 45.4(c)(2); and 
(3) calculating the variation margin 
amount for the swap under § 23.155. 
1. Proposal 
To harmonize these similar but not 
identical calculations so that a Swap 
Entity is only required to make a single 
calculation of the valuation of the swap, 
the Commission proposed to reorganize 
§ 23.431(d) such that paragraphs (d)(1) 
and (d)(2) would address the 
requirements for, and cover the 
exceptions from, respectively, the daily 
mark requirement for cleared swaps (as 
discussed in Section II.C below), and 
paragraph (d)(3) would address the

requirements for, and cover the 
exceptions from, the daily mark 
requirement for uncleared swaps, 
including a description of the daily 
mark for uncleared swaps to be ‘‘the 
estimated price that would be received 
by the counterparty to sell (expressed as 
a positive number), or be paid by the 
counterparty to transfer (expressed as a 
negative number), the uncleared swap 
in the market in an orderly transaction.’’ 
The goal of this proposed change was to 
harmonize the daily mark disclosure 
requirement in § 23.431(d)(2) with the 
Commission’s uncleared swap margin 
rules and swap data reporting rules. 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
Only the ISDA/SIFMA Letter 
specifically addressed the proposed 
change to the daily mark disclosure 
requirements. ISDA/SIFMA generally 
supported the Commission amending its 
daily mark requirements; however, 
rather than revising it as proposed, 
ISDA/SIFMA suggested that a better, 
more streamlined approach would be to 
(1) amend the definition of ‘‘daily mark’’ 
to provide Swap Entities with more 
flexibility in determining the mark, 
while still maintaining requirements for 
Swap Entities to disclose the 
methodologies and assumptions used to 
prepare the daily mark; and (2) 
eliminate the daily mark requirement 
for all non-cleared swaps that are 
subject to daily variation margining, 
arguing that this approach would better 
enable firms to align their daily mark 
disclosures under Commission 
Regulations with the methodologies 
they use for other purposes, whether for 
reporting, daily mark disclosures under 
SEC rules, internal valuation purposes, 
or otherwise. ISDA/SIFMA further 
argued that, given the institutional 
nature of the swap market, disclosure of 
the daily mark methodologies and 
assumptions, as provided in proposed 
§ 23.431(d)(4), should provide 
counterparties with sufficient 
information to understand the daily 
marks they receive. 
After considering these comments, the 
Commission has determined to amend 
its daily mark requirement under 
§ 23.431(d) with some modifications 
from the Proposal. Specifically, at the 
suggestion of commenters, the 
Commission has determined to provide 
Swap Entities with greater flexibility in 
determining how to calculate daily 
marks for uncleared swaps, concluding 
that such flexibility would be a simpler 
way of achieving the Commission’s goal 
in the Proposal of harmonizing the daily 
mark requirement with the other daily 
swap valuation requirements in the 
Commission’s uncleared swap margin 
and swap reporting rules. In adopting 
the amendments to the daily mark 
requirement, the Commission notes that 
‘‘daily mark’’ is not defined in the CEA 
and the Commission is persuaded by the 
comments of ISDA/SIFMA that 
disclosure of the methodology and 
assumptions required under final 
§ 23.431(d)(4) is sufficient for 
counterparties to Swap Entities to 
determine for themselves the value of 
the daily mark received. In addition, the 
Commission has determined that, with 
respect to swaps subject to daily 
variation margin delivery requirements, 
whether subject to the Commission’s 
variation requirements set forth in 
§ 23.150 through § 23.161 or otherwise, 
notice of variation margin amounts 
necessarily entails valuation of each 
swap and thus such delivery 
requirements fulfill the Swap Entity’s 
requirement to provide a daily mark 
under section 4s(h)(3)(B) of the CEA. 
Variation margin amounts are the 
change in the net present value of a 
swap since the last time the variation 
margin amount was exchanged between 
the parties. The daily mark is essentially 
the net present value of the swap, thus 
notice of variation margin amounts is 
materially equivalent to notice of the 
daily mark. 
To effect these changes, the Final Rule 
excludes swaps subject to daily 
variation margining from the 
requirements of § 23.431(d)(3) and (4) 
and removes the requirement that the 
daily mark be the mid-market mark of 
the swap in § 23.431(d)(3) and related 
text, as reflected in the final rule text 
infra. 
D. New and Amended Definitions in 
§ 23.401 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
proposed adding several new 
definitions to § 23.401
91
and to amend 
a number of existing definitions in such 
section solely for the purposes of the 
subpart. These new and amended 
definitions are discussed below. 
1. Definition of ITBC Swap 
a. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to add a 
new eight-prong definition of ‘‘ITBC 
Swap’’ to the definitions in § 23.401 
applicable to subpart H of part 23 of the 
Commission’s regulations.
92
 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
explained that defining ‘‘ITBC Swap’’ in 
§ 23.401 was intended to clearly 
describe the criteria and conditions that 
a swap must meet to be eligible for the 
various proposed exceptions from the 
disclosure, information collection, and 
documentation requirements of the 
External Business Conduct Standards 
and the STRD Requirement (hereinafter, 
the ‘‘ITBC Compliance Exceptions’’), 
each of which are explained in the 
relevant sections below.
93
The 
Commission noted that, other than what 
has been described in the Proposal, the 
criteria and conditions within the 
proposed definition are substantially the 
same as the conditions necessary to 
qualify for the MPD no-action position 
set forth in CFTC Staff Letter 23–01. 
First, under the Proposal, one of the 
parties to the swap must be a ‘‘swap 
entity’’ as defined in new § 23.401(j) to 
mean an SD or MSP.
94
‘‘Swap entity’’ is 
used throughout the definitions and the 
proposed amendments to refer to an SD 
or MSP. The External Business Conduct 
Standards and the STRD Requirement 
only apply to Swap Entities. Thus, 
swaps where no Swap Entity is a 
counterparty have no need to qualify for 
the ITBC Compliance Exceptions. 
Second, the swap would be required 
to be of a type accepted for clearing by 
a DCO registered with the Commission 
or an Exempt DCO.
95
Only swaps that 
are of a type accepted for clearing by a 
DCO or Exempt DCO qualify for the 
ITBC Compliance Exceptions. Thus, 
even if a Swap Entity and its 
counterparty enter into a swap that they 
intend to clear, but the swap is not of 
a type accepted for clearing on a DCO 
or Exempt DCO, such swap would not 
qualify for the ITBC Compliance 
Exceptions. 
Third, the parties to the swap would 
be required to execute the swap with the 
present intention that the swap will be 
cleared contemporaneously with 
execution. The Commission noted in the 
Proposal that the ITBC Compliance 
Exceptions would not be available for a 
swap that is entered bilaterally between 
two parties who then decide later that 
they would like to submit the swap for 
clearing. A swap that is not intended to 
be cleared contemporaneously with 
execution means that there will be a 
trading relationship between the Swap 
Entity and its counterparty for some 
material period of time, which would 
necessitate compliance by the Swap 
Entity with the Commission’s swap 
reporting, disclosure, and uncleared 
swap margin rules. While parties are 
free to enter into swaps that they intend 
to clear but are not cleared 
contemporaneously with execution,

See Proposed Rule, 90 FR at 47144. such swaps would not be ITBC Swaps 
and such swaps would not qualify for 
the ITBC Swap Compliance Exceptions. 
Fourth, if the swap is intended to be 
cleared on a DCO, the Swap Entity and 
its counterparty would be required to 
either be clearing members of the DCO 
or have entered into an agreement with 
a clearing member of the DCO (i.e., a futures commission merchant (‘‘FCM’’)) 
for clearing of swaps of the same type 
as the swap intended to be cleared. The 
Commission explained that this 
condition is necessary to ensure that a 
swap that the Swap Entity and its 
counterparty intend to be cleared 
contemporaneously with execution can 
actually be cleared on the DCO. A Swap 
Entity or a counterparty that is not a 
clearing member of the DCO, or that has 
not entered into an agreement with an 
FCM that is a clearing member of the 
DCO covering the type of swap intended 
to be cleared, cannot actually clear the 
swap, no matter the intention of the 
parties to the swap. 
Fifth, if the swap is intended to be 
cleared on an Exempt DCO, the Swap 
Entity and its counterparty would be 
required to be eligible to clear the swap 
on the Exempt DCO in accordance with 
the terms and conditions of the Exempt 
DCO’s Order of Exemption from 
Registration issued by the Commission. 
Each Exempt DCO is exempt from 
registration pursuant to a unique order 
issued by the Commission, which may 
contain conditions and limitations to 
the Exempt DCO’s ability to clear 
certain products for or on behalf of U.S. 
Persons pursuant to that order.
96
Most 
importantly, clearing members of some 
Exempt DCOs that are U.S. Persons (as 
defined in the exemption orders) may 
only clear swaps for themselves and 
those affiliates that meet the definition 
of ‘‘proprietary account’’ in § 1.3.
97
In 
the Proposal, the Commission explained 
that this proposed eligibility condition 
is necessary to ensure that a swap that 
the Swap Entity and its counterparty 
intend to be cleared contemporaneously 
with execution can actually be cleared 
on the Exempt DCO.
98
A Swap Entity or 
a counterparty that is not eligible to 
clear a swap on an Exempt DCO or has 
not entered into an agreement with a 
clearing member of the Exempt DCO 
covering the type of swap intended to be 
cleared cannot actually clear the swap, 
no matter the intention of the parties to 
the swap. 
Sixth, the Commission proposed that 
the Swap Entity would be prohibited 
from requiring its counterparty or the 
counterparty’s clearing member (i.e., the counterparty’s FCM) to enter into a 
breakage agreement or similar 
agreement as a condition to executing 
the swap intended to be cleared, but 
would not prohibit a Swap Entity from 
entering into a breakage or similar 
agreement at the request of a 
counterparty (the ‘‘Breakage 
Condition’’).
99
The Commission 
explained that, generally, this condition, 
as proposed, was meant to ensure that 
the parties to such swap are entering 
into the swap with the expectation that 
the swap will be cleared and would not 
enter into the swap absent such 
expectation.
100
The Commission noted 
that, where a Swap Entity requires a 
breakage agreement pursuant to which 
parties agree in advance that if the swap 
does not clear then either the swap will 
be considered a bilateral swap between 
the parties, or one party will owe a 
‘‘breakage’’ payment to the other party 
to compensate such party for costs or 
damages incurred due to the failure to 
clear is evidence that the Swap Entity 
may not be entering into the swap with 
the requisite intention that the swap 
will be a cleared swap. In the Proposal, 
the Commission preliminarily 
determined that the same is not true 
where a breakage agreement is requested 
by the counterparty.
101
In such case, the 
Commission believes it is more likely 
that the counterparty’s main concern is 
that its intended position be established 
by the swap, whether cleared or 
uncleared. Accordingly, the 
Commission stated its intent that a 
counterparty to a Swap Entity could 
request a breakage agreement and thus 
a swap executed bilaterally between the 
parties that is rejected from clearing 
may not be void ab initio.
102
For 
instance, where a counterparty intends 
to clear a swap but, if it fails to clear, 
still desires or needs the swap to exist 
to support a trading strategy, such 
counterparty may request that the Swap 
Entity enter into a breakage agreement 
that provides for an alternative to 
clearing if a swap fails to clear (e.g., that the swap could become a bilateral swap 
between the Swap Entity and the 
counterparty). 
Seventh, the Swap Entity would be 
required to ensure that the swap is 
submitted for clearing as quickly after 
execution as would be technologically 
practicable if fully automated systems 
were used (the ‘‘Clearing Submission 
Condition’’).
103
The Commission 
explained that this proposed condition 
sets forth a standard for submission of the swap for clearing to a DCO or 
Exempt DCO and would be in addition 
to the obligations in § 23.506 (which 
requires a Swap Entity to coordinate 
prompt and efficient swap transaction 
processing with the DCO)
104
and 
§ 23.610 (which requires the Swap 
Entity to accept or reject each trade 
submitted to the DCO for clearing as 
quickly as would be technologically 
practicable if fully automated systems 
were used).
105
The Commission 
included this condition to ensure that a 
swap executed with the intention to be 
cleared is actually submitted for 
clearing as soon as possible after 
execution.
106
The proposed ITBC 
Compliance Exceptions are based on the 
concept that there will be no contractual 
or trading relationship between a Swap 
Entity and its counterparty with respect 
to a swap intended to be cleared, so it 
is crucial that there be no delay between 
execution and submission to clearing.
107
 
For example, a delay in clearing of even 
one business day implicates compliance 
by the Swap Entity with the 
Commission’s swap reporting, 
disclosure, and uncleared swap margin 
rules. 
Eighth, the Commission proposed to 
require that if the swap is executed on 
a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF and is 
rejected from clearing, the swap must be 
void ab initio (the ‘‘Void Ab Initio Condition’’).
108
As explained in the 
Proposal, this was a modification of the 
void ab initio conditions in CFTC Staff Letter 23–01, which stipulated that any 
ITBC Swap must be void ab initio if 
rejected from clearing, whether 
executed on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt 
SEF or executed bilaterally between a 
Swap Entity and its counterparty.
109
 
This modification of the condition in 
CFTC Staff Letter 23–01 is necessitated 
by the Commission’s recognition in 
condition six, discussed above, that a 
counterparty may request a breakage 
agreement from a Swap Entity while the 
Commission maintained a prohibition 
on Swap Entities requiring breakage 
agreements as a condition to entering 
into a swap. 
The Commission stated that 
compliance with this condition as 
proposed may be accomplished by 
executing the swap on a SEF or DCM

where such SEF or DCM is required to 
have rules requiring swaps submitted 
for clearing to be void ab initio if not 
cleared.
110
However, if the swap is not 
executed on a SEF, DCM, or Exempt 
SEF that has rules requiring swaps 
submitted for clearing to be void ab 
initio if not cleared, then it would be incumbent on the Swap Entity to ensure 
that it has agreed with its counterparty 
that if such swap intended to be cleared 
fails to clear, the swap will be deemed 
by the parties to be void ab initio (a 
‘‘Void Ab Initio Agreement’’).111
That is, 
the swap will be deemed to have never 
been executed. The Commission 
recognized that Swap Entities routinely 
enter into swaps with counterparties 
that are intended to be cleared (whether 
anonymously or otherwise) and 
therefore may have no pre-existing 
relationship with such counterparties 
where a Void Ab Initio Agreement could 
be documented.
112
However, the 
Commission noted its preliminary belief 
that such an agreement can be made 
part of the terms of the swap agreed at 
execution and would not require a 
separate agreement between the parties 
(i.e., a Void Ab Initio Agreement may be a term of the swap agreed at 
execution).
113
 
b. Comments Received and Final Rule 
Only the ISDA/SIFMA Letter and 
Citadel Letter specifically addressed the 
proposed definition of ‘‘ITBC Swap.’’ 
ISDA/SIFMA firmly supported 
providing relief for ITBC Swaps and 
generally supported the Commission’s 
proposed definition of an ITBC Swap 
but noted three specific concerns. 
First, ISDA/SIFMA noted that the 
Breakage Condition could be read to 
imply that a Swap Entity may not raise 
the topic of a breakage or similar 
agreement with a counterparty. It argues 
that a Swap Entity must be permitted to 
initiate discussion about how to address 
ITBC Swaps with its counterparty as a 
matter of good risk management, and 
such discussions—whether at the 
request of the Swap Entity or its 
counterparty—do not indicate that 
either party is entering into the swap 
without the requisite intention that the 
swap will not be a cleared swap. 
Second, ISDA/SIFMA stated that the 
Commission should explicitly clarify 
that, under the Clearing Submission 
Condition, Swap Entities are not 
responsible for guaranteeing that their 
counterparties will take the necessary 
steps for submission (outside of 
reasonably designed policies and 
procedures), as Swap Entities are only 
able to control their own actions and 
processes. 
Third, ISDA/SIFMA stated that they 
have practical concerns regarding the 
implementation of the Void Ab Initio 
Condition in the context of Exempt 
SEFs that do not impose void ab initio 
rules. They note that entering into a 
Void Ab Initio Agreement at the point of execution is not practical given actual 
trading practices on Exempt SEFs and, 
therefore, should not be required. 
Instead, they argue that the Commission 
should allow for more flexibility by 
enabling Swap Entities to determine 
how to address such rejected 
transactions. Under this approach, for 
ITBC Swaps executed on Exempt SEFs 
that do not impose void ab initio 
requirements, they ask that a Swap 
Entity may choose to either put breakage 
agreements in place with its 
counterparties prior to execution (so 
long as such breakage agreements are 
not a condition to trading), or may 
otherwise have a Void Ab Initio 
Agreement in place, prior to execution. 
They argue this approach is not only 
more operationally-feasible but would 
also be consistent with the 
Commission’s position for bilaterally 
executed ITBC swaps. 
With respect to the Void Ab Initio 
Condition, Citadel, on the other hand, 
strongly recommended that the 
Commission maintain a requirement 
that any ITBC Swap executed on a DCM, 
SEF, or Exempt SEF be deemed void ab 
initio if such swap fails to clear. Citadel argued that the Commission’s goal of 
facilitating exchange trading of cleared 
swaps would not be advanced by 
allowing for ITBC Swaps traded on a 
DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF to be subject 
to breakage or other types of agreements 
that would allow such swaps to survive 
a failure to clear. 
After considering these comments, the 
Commission has determined to adopt a 
definition of ‘‘ITBC Swap’’ with certain 
modifications from the Proposal. 
First, the Commission is revising the 
Clearing Submission Condition by 
replacing the word ‘‘ensures’’ in the 
proposed definition with the words 
‘‘takes reasonable measures to ensure,’’ 
as shown in the final rule text, infra. 
This change is meant to clarify that a 
Swap Entity does not have to accept 
liability for a failure of its counterparty 
to take the necessary steps for clearing. 
Further, the Commission intends that 
this condition will be satisfied, with 
respect to a counterparty, where a Swap 
Entity has entered into an agreement 
with such counterparty that require the 
counterparty to submit the swap for 
clearing to a DCO or Exempt DCO, as 
applicable, as quickly after execution as 
would be technologically practicable if 
fully automated systems were used. 
Second, the Commission is modifying 
the Void Ab Initio Condition, as 
reflected in paragraph (8) of the ITBC 
Swap definition in the final rule text 
infra, to provide that, where a swap is executed on or pursuant to the rules of 
an Exempt SEF and the rules of such 
Exempt SEF do not provide for a swap 
rejected from clearing to be deemed 
void ab initio, the condition will be satisfied solely if the parties have prior 
to or at execution of the swap (1) 
entered into a Void Ab Initio 
Agreement, or (2) agreed that a breakage 
agreement or similar arrangement (as 
contemplated in the Breakage Condition 
(condition 6 of the ITBC Swap 
definition discussed above)) applies to 
the swap. The Commission is adopting 
additional language (as reflected in the 
final rule text infra) in the Void Ab 
Initio Condition in paragraphs (7) and (8) to make clear that the terms of any 
such breakage agreement or similar 
arrangement must take into account the 
Swap Entity’s regulatory obligations 
under the External Business Conduct 
Standards and the STRD Requirement, 
including those that are required to be 
completed prior to execution of a swap 
with a non-Swap Entity counterparty. 
Similarly, the Commission is 
modifying paragraph (7) of the 
definition of ‘‘ITBC Swap’’ as reflected 
in the final rule text, infra, to require that parties to a bilaterally executed 
swap have prior to or at execution of the 
swap (i) entered into a Void Ab Initio 
Agreement, or (ii) agreed that a breakage 
agreement or similar arrangement (as 
contemplated in the Breakage Condition 
discussed above) applies to the swap. 
The Commission noted in the Proposal 
that it did not include a void ab initio 
requirement for bilateral swaps to allow 
for counterparties to Swap Entities to 
request these types of breakage 
arrangements under certain 
circumstances;
114
however, the 
Commission did not include a related 
condition in the rule text in the 
Proposal. As a technical addition, the 
Commission is now adding that 
condition, as it has determined that, as 
discussed in the Proposal,

131
See Proposed Rule, 90 FR at 47145. Void Ab Initio Agreement or such breakage arrangement or similar 
arrangement must exist for a bilateral 
swap to be an ITBC Swap eligible for the 
exceptions for ITBC Swaps provided in 
this Final Rule. 
The additional flexibility the 
Commission is providing around the 
Void Ab Initio Condition is intended to address practical concerns raised by 
ISDA/SIFMA with respect to the 
operation of the Void Ab Initio 
Condition on Exempt SEFs, as initially 
proposed. With respect to the comment 
of Citadel discussed above, the 
Commission has determined that 
because (1) it would be impractical for 
the Commission to revisit the various 
orders that it has previously granted to 
Exempt SEFs to impose conditions that 
would require such Exempt SEFs to 
have rules requiring that swaps that fail 
to clear are void ab initio, and (2) it 
would likely be impracticable for a 
Swap Entity to enter into a Void Ab 
Initio Agreement at the point of 
execution for swaps executed on an 
Exempt SEF, the Commission will not 
make the Void Ab Initio Condition 
applicable to ITBC Swaps executed on 
an Exempt SEF to the same extent that 
such condition in paragraph (8) applies 
to swaps executed on a DCM or SEF, 
provided, however, that in any case and 
as required by the Breakage Condition, 
a Swap Entity does not make entering 
into a breakage agreement a pre- 
condition to entering into an ITBC 
Swap.
116
 
In addition, the Commission is 
clarifying that that it does not intend the 
Breakage Condition to limit the ability 
of Swap Entities to discuss breakage 
agreements with their counterparties, 
either at their own behest or at that of 
their counterparty. Rather, the Breakage 
Condition solely prohibits Swap Entities 
from requiring a counterparty to enter 
into a breakage agreement as a condition 
to trading. 
2. Definition of A–ITBC Swap 
a. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to add a 
new definition of ‘‘A–ITBC Swap’’ to 
the definitions in § 23.401
117
applicable 
to subpart H of part 23 of the 
Commission’s regulations.
118
The 
Proposal defined an ‘‘A–ITBC Swap’’ or 
‘‘Anonymous ITBC Swap’’ to mean an 
ITBC Swap (as defined in new 
§ 23.401(d)) where the Swap Entity does 
not know the identity of the 
counterparty prior to execution of the 
swap.
119
The proposed definition 
explains that an A–ITBC Swap may be 
executed on or pursuant to the rules of 
a SEF, DCM, or Exempt SEF, or may be 
executed bilaterally between a Swap 
Entity and a counterparty (such as 
where a Swap Entity enters into a 
‘‘block trade’’ with an asset manager 
that intends to allocate portions of a 
swap to various funds or accounts under 
management post-clearing).
120
In the 
Proposal, the Commission stated that a 
definition of ‘‘A–ITBC Swap’’ in 
§ 23.401 will help to distinguish ITBC 
Swaps that are executed in 
circumstances where the Swap Entity 
knows the identity of its counterparty 
prior to execution from those that it 
does not for purposes of application of 
the proposed ITBC Compliance 
Exceptions.
121
 
b. Comments Received and Final Rule 
The Commission received no 
comments relating specifically to this 
definition and is adopting this term as 
proposed, as shown in the final rule 
text, infra. 3. Definition of Covered Transaction 
a. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to add a 
new definition of ‘‘Covered 
Transaction’’ to the definitions in 
§ 23.401
122
applicable to subpart H of 
part 23 of the Commission’s regulations. 
The Proposal defined the term ‘‘Covered 
Transaction’’ to mean a swap, as defined 
in section 1a(47) of the Act and § 1.3 of 
chapter I (other than swaps subject to 
the clearing requirement of section 
2(h)(1)(A) of the Act and part 50 of 
chapter I), and physically-settled foreign 
exchange forwards and swaps that have 
been exempted from the definition of 
swap by the U.S. Department of the 
Treasury.
123
The definition was 
intended to encompass all transaction 
types that may be subject to a Prime 
Broker Arrangement (defined and 
explained infra). As such, the proposed definition encompasses swaps, as 
defined in section 1a(47) of the CEA,
124
 
but excludes swaps that are subject to 
the Commission’s swap clearing 
requirement in section 2(h)(1)(A) of the 
CEA
125
and part 50 of the Commission’s 
regulations.
126
Based on the 
Commission’s understanding, swaps 
subject to Prime Broker Arrangements 
are exclusively uncleared swaps. The 
proposed definition of Covered 
Transactions also included Exempt FX 
Transactions, which, as explained 
above, are not swaps (having been 
excluded from such definition by the 
Treasury Determination), but are 
nonetheless subject to the External 
Business Conduct Standards if entered 
into by a Swap Entity with a 
counterparty that is not a Swap 
Entity.
127
The Proposal explained that 
the Commission intends for the 
definition of ‘‘Covered Transaction’’ to 
be substantially the same as the 
definition of such term set forth CFTC 
Staff Letters 13–11 and 19–06.
128
 
b. Comments Received and Final Rule 
The Commission received no 
comments relating specifically to this 
definition and is adopting this term as 
proposed, as shown in the final rule 
text, infra. 4. Definition of Prime Broker 
Arrangement 
a. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to add a 
new definition of ‘‘Prime Broker 
Arrangement’’ to the definitions in 
§ 23.401
129
applicable to subpart H of 
part 23 of the Commission’s 
regulations.
130
The definition was 
intended to universally encompass the 
various agreements and arrangements 
that constitute the credit intermediation 
service provided by a PB to their swap 
PB customers that allows such PB 
customers to seek prices on Covered 
Transactions from a variety of 
counterparties while only facing the PB 
for its ongoing obligations under 
Covered Transactions and allowing for 
collateral netting, but is also meant to 
recognize the roles of other parties, 
including, without limitation, executing 
dealers, intermediaries, and other 
PBs.

See id., 90 FR at 47145. 
A Prime Broker Arrangement, as 
proposed, included at least one PB/SD 
and two or more other parties evidenced 
by a written agreement or 
agreements.
132
Pursuant to such written 
agreements, the PB/SD, subject to any 
applicable pre-conditions, would be 
contractually obligated to enter into a 
Covered Transaction (as defined in 
§ 23.401 and explained above) that 
constitutes a PB trigger transaction (the 
‘‘Trigger Transaction’’)
133
with a 
counterparty that may or may not be a 
Swap Entity, may be a PB customer of 
the PB/SD, an executing dealer, or 
another PB (the ‘‘Trigger Counterparty’’) 
and for which the PB/SD has not 
determined the price. The execution of 
the Trigger Transaction must also 
obligate the PB/SD to enter into a 
second Covered Transaction (the 
‘‘Mirror Transaction’’)
134
with another 
counterparty that is not the Trigger 
Counterparty (the ‘‘Mirror 
Counterparty’’), which is a PB customer 
of the PB/SD and to whom the PB/SD 
owes regulatory obligations under the 
External Business Conduct Standards. 
The terms and price of the Mirror 
Transaction, from the perspective of the 
PB/SD, must be substantially equal but 
opposite to the terms and price of the 
Trigger Transaction. 
The proposed ‘‘substantially equal but 
opposite’’ requirement in the Proposal 
was in recognition by the Commission 
that the terms and the price of a Mirror 
Transaction may be adjusted from those 
of a Trigger Transaction to allow for a 
spread or fee to be paid to the PB/SD, 
(or to an intermediary that has arranged 
the transaction), to compensate the PB/ 
SD or the intermediary for providing the 
credit intermediation service evidenced 
by the Prime Broker Arrangement or the 
intermediary’s services.
135
In the 
Proposal, the Commission also 
recognized that the designation of a 
Trigger Transaction and a Mirror 
Transaction depends on the perspective 
of the parties to the transaction.
136
For 
example, where two PBs are involved, 
the Mirror Transaction for one PB may 
be a Trigger Transaction for the second 
PB. The Commission also acknowledged 
that a single Trigger Transaction may 
trigger a string of transactions between 
various PBs and their PB customers, 
some of which could be both Trigger 
Transactions and Mirror 
Transactions.
137
 
The intention of the proposed 
definition of ‘‘Prime Broker 
Arrangement’’ was to capture the 
essence of the concept of credit 
intermediation through swap PB 
arrangements as it relates to compliance 
with the External Business Conduct 
Standards.
138
The Commission stated its 
preliminary view that such essence lies 
in the fact that a PB/SD, due to its 
contractual obligations under the 
various forms of Prime Broker 
Arrangements, will, when certain 
specified pre-conditions are met, be 
contractually obligated to enter into a 
Covered Transaction for which it has 
not determined the price and 
simultaneously be obligated to enter 
into a substantially equal but opposite 
Covered Transaction, the price of which 
is determined based on the price of the 
first transaction.
139
The Commission 
acknowledged that where a PB/SD is 
entering into transactions with non- 
Swap Entity counterparties for which it 
has not determined the price prior to 
execution, it cannot comply with the 
price and PTMMM disclosure 
requirements of the External Business 
Conduct Standards.
140
 
b. Comments Received and Final Rule 
Only the ISDA/SIFMA Letter 
specifically addressed the proposed 
definition of ‘‘Prime Broker 
Arrangement.’’ 
First, ISDA/SIFMA requested certain 
changes to the definition to account for 
a situation where a PB customer 
determines that the execution desk of its 
SD/PB provides better pricing than 
other executing dealers. Such customers 
may, in their own discretion, choose to 
price/execute with that desk for give-up 
to its SD/PB. ISDA/SIFMA argue that 
market practice is for PBs to maintain an 
appropriate level of separation between 
their sales and trading business (i.e., the executing desk), including information 
barriers. Thus, in practice, the pricing 
and execution mechanics between a PB 
customer and the execution desk of that 
SD/PB is similar to pricing and 
execution with an external SD. The 
Commission considered this comment 
but declines to make the change 
requested by ISDA/SIFMA to the 
definition of ‘‘Prime Broker 
Arrangement.’’ In the scenario 
explained by ISDA/SIFMA, the same 
legal entity is both the executing dealer 
entering into the Trigger Transaction 
and the PB entering into the Mirror 
Transaction with the PB customer. 
Because the executing dealer and PB are 
both parts of the same legal entity, and 
that legal entity is a registered SD, the 
executing dealer is required under 
§ 23.431(a) to disclose the material 
economic terms and the price of the 
swap prior to execution. Having made 
such disclosure, the legal entity that is 
the PB/SD has fulfilled the regulatory 
obligations that would otherwise be 
excepted by the Final Rule. Thus, the 
Commission has determined that there 
is no reason to include the change 
requested by ISDA/SIFMA to the 
definition of Prime Broker Arrangement 
because there is no need to provide an 
exception from the regulatory 
obligations of an SD/PB that acts as both 
the executing dealer and the PB. 
Further, the Commission does not 
believe that a Commission regulation is 
the appropriate place to account for the 
purely internal arrangements that an 
SD/PB may have between its PB desk 
and its swap trading desks. 
Second, ISDA/SIFMA requested 
changes to the definition of Prime 
Broker Arrangement to clearly recognize 
in the rule text that a Mirror Transaction 
may include a spread or fees to 
compensate a Prime Broker for 
providing the credit intermediation 
services. In the Proposal, as discussed 
above, the Commission had proposed 
that, from the perspective of the PB/SD, 
the Mirror Transaction must be 
‘‘substantially’’ equal but opposite to the 
terms and price of the Trigger 
Transaction (but not identical), 
recognizing that the terms and the price 
of a Mirror Transaction may be adjusted 
from those of a Trigger Transaction to 
allow for a spread or fee to be paid to 
the PB/SD, (or to an intermediary that 
has arranged the transaction), to 
compensate the PB/SD or an 
intermediary for providing the credit 
intermediation service evidenced by the 
Prime Broker Arrangement or the 
intermediary’s services. ISDA/SIFMA 
request that the ‘‘substantially equal’’ 
language be replaced with an explicit 
recognition that a Mirror Transaction 
may contain a spread or fee that makes 
it somewhat different from the Trigger 
Transaction. The Commission has 
concluded that such explicit recognition 
would better address any ambiguity that 
may have existed in the Proposal on this 
point and has thus added clarifying 
language to the definition of ‘‘Prime 
Broker Arrangement,’’ as shown in the 
final rule text infra.

See Proposed Rule, 90 FR at 47147. 5. Definition of Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangement 
a. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to add a 
new definition of ‘‘Qualified Prime 
Broker Arrangement’’
141
to the 
definitions in § 23.401
142
applicable to 
subpart H of part 23 of the 
Commission’s regulations.
143
The 
definition incorporated conditions that, 
if met by a PB/SD’s Prime Broker 
Arrangement with a particular non- 
Swap Entity counterparty (each a ‘‘PB 
Counterparty’’), would permit the PB/ 
SD to qualify for an exception to the 
price disclosure requirement (and 
PTMMM Requirement, if applicable) in 
§ 23.431(a)(3)
144
with respect to 
Covered Transactions with such PB 
Counterparty.
145
In the Proposal, the 
Commission determined that providing 
an exception from the price disclosure 
obligation (and, if necessary, the 
PTMMM disclosure obligation) of an SD 
when entering into a swap pursuant to 
a Qualified Prime Broker Arrangement 
is a reasonable accommodation to the 
long-standing prime broker 
arrangements prevalent in the swaps 
market prior to promulgation of the 
External Business Conduct 
Standards.
146
This view was based on 
the fact that Prime Broker Arrangements 
are entered into by swap counterparties 
seeking certain benefits, among which 
are: (1) the ability of swap 
counterparties to seek favorable pricing 
from a wide variety of market 
participants, rather than just a handful 
of SDs with which they may have 
trading relationships; (2) the credit 
intermediation provided by PBs that 
permits price shopping by swap 
counterparties but consolidates credit 
risk of the swap counterparty with only 
their PB(s); and (3) the consolidation of 
credit risk with only their PB(s) that 
permits for more efficient use of 
collateral through netting of positions 
with only their PB(s).
147
In the Proposal, 
the Commission expressed its view that 
an insistence on price disclosure by an 
SD acting as a PB, a requirement that 
was intended to provide a benefit to 
non-Swap Entity counterparties, would 
undermine that very benefit and 
eliminate all of the other benefits of 
Prime Broker Arrangements to swap 
counterparties, forcing such 
counterparties to trade swaps only with 
a handful of SDs with the concomitant 
loss of competitive pricing.
148
Thus, the 
Commission proposed the following 
conditions for a Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangement that would qualify for an 
exception to the price disclosure. 
First, to qualify as a Qualified Prime 
Broker Arrangement under the Proposed 
Rule, the Prime Broker Arrangement 
between a PB/SD and its PB 
Counterparty would be required to 
contain an agreement in writing on the 
type, parameters, and limits of each 
potential Covered Transaction that may 
be entered into by the PB Counterparty 
with the PB/SD pursuant to the Prime 
Broker Arrangement (each, a ‘‘Permitted 
PB Transaction’’).
149
This proposed 
condition would require the PB/SD to: 
(1) Clearly delineate the types of 
transactions that the PB/SD will be 
obligated to enter into with the PB 
Counterparty pursuant to the Prime 
Broker Arrangement; 
(2) To list all of the pre-conditions to 
the PB/SD’s obligation to enter into each 
type of Permitted PB Transaction; 
(3) To list all acceptable terms for 
each type of Permitted PB Transaction 
(such as tenor, payment terms, payment 
calculation terms, termination events, 
rate fallbacks, etc.); and 
(4) To set limits (credit, market, trade 
volume, etc.) for each type of Permitted 
PB Transaction.
150
 
As discussed in the Proposal, the 
purpose of this proposed condition was 
to ensure that, before execution of any 
Covered Transaction, the parties will 
know exactly what the PB/SD is 
required to execute with the PB 
Counterparty, thereby making 
compliance with the other conditions of 
the Qualified Prime Broker Arrangement 
definition possible.
151
A PB/SD and its 
PB Counterparty would, of course, be 
free to update or adjust the parameters 
of Permitted PB Transactions at any 
time by agreeing to an amendment to 
their Prime Broker Arrangement.
152
 
Second, the PB/SD, now knowing the 
types and terms of all possible Covered 
Transactions that may be executed with 
the PB Counterparty pursuant to their 
Prime Broker Arrangement, would be 
required to provide the PB Counterparty 
with all disclosures that would be 
necessary for the Prime Broker to 
comply with § 23.431(a)
153
other than 
the pre-trade disclosure of the price of 
any Permitted PB Transaction (and the 
PTMMM, if applicable).
154
The Proposal 
also noted that if the Commission 
determined not to eliminate the scenario 
analysis requirement in § 23.431(b)
155
 
(as discussed above), the PB/SD would 
also be required to provide a scenario 
analysis of any Permitted PB 
Transaction if requested by the PB 
Counterparty (the §§ 23.431(a) and (b) 
required disclosures and, if requested, 
the scenario analysis, are hereinafter 
referred to as the ‘‘Regulatory 
Disclosures’’).
156
These Regulatory 
Disclosures would include material 
information concerning a Permitted PB 
Transaction provided in a manner 
reasonably designed to allow the PB 
Counterparty to assess: 
(1) The material risks of a particular 
type of Permitted PB Transaction, which 
may include market, credit, liquidity, 
foreign currency, legal, operational, and 
any other applicable risks; 
(2) The material characteristics of a 
particular type of Permitted PB 
Transaction, which would include the 
material economic terms of the 
Permitted PB Transaction, the terms 
relating to the operation of the 
Permitted PB Transaction, and the rights 
and obligations of the parties during the 
term of the Permitted PB Transaction; 
and 
(3) The material incentives and 
conflicts of interest that the PB/SD may 
have in connection with a particular 
type of Permitted PB Transaction, which 
would include any compensation or 
other incentive from any source other 
than the PB Counterparty that the PB/ 
SD may receive in connection with a 
particular type of Permitted PB 
Transaction.
157
 
As proposed, the disclosure obligation 
of the PB/SD under this second 
condition would be limited to the PB/ 
SD’s knowledge and reasonable belief at 
the time of disclosure.
158
In the 
Proposal, the Commission also stated 
that it would consider a PB/SD to have 
met this condition if such disclosure is 
substantially the same as its disclosures 
to non-PB Counterparties for the same 
types of Covered Transactions, so long 
as such disclosures to non-PB 
Counterparties are not found deficient. 
The Commission noted that this 
proposed condition would impose an 
on-going disclosure requirement that 
must be updated to the extent the PB/ 
SD becomes aware of information that 
would make a previous disclosure 
incorrect, incomplete, or misleading.

membership/files/application-and-clearing- 
agreement-writeable.pdf. 
Third, the PB/SD would be required 
under the Proposed Rule to receive an 
acknowledgement from a PB 
Counterparty regarding various 
disclosures.
159
The acknowledgement 
would state that: (1) the PB 
Counterparty has received the 
Regulatory Disclosures; and (2) the PB/ 
SD has clarified or supplemented the 
Regulatory Disclosures as requested by 
the PB Counterparty in its sole 
discretion.
160
Furthermore, under the 
Proposal, the acknowledgement would 
provide that the PB/SD has no 
obligation to provide additional 
disclosures pursuant to section 
4s(h)(3)(B)(i) of the CEA
161
or 
§ 23.431(a) or (b) with respect to a 
Permitted PB Transactions so long as 
the PB/SD is not aware of information 
that would make the disclosure 
incorrect, incomplete, or misleading.
162
 
PB Counterparties would be permitted 
to request updated disclosures in 
writing prior to execution. This 
proposed condition was not intended to 
release the PB/SD from its obligation to 
update the Regulatory Disclosures as 
necessary to meet the standard of the 
PB/SD’s ‘‘knowledge and reasonable 
belief.’’
163
Rather, the Commission 
explained that the purpose of the 
proposed condition is to make clear that 
once the PB/SD has met such standard 
and given the PB Counterparty an 
opportunity to request clarifications or 
supplements, there is a bright line 
drawn to show the end of the PB/SDs 
obligations for disclosure under 
§ 23.431(a) and (b).
164
 
Finally, the PB/SD would be required 
to make and keep a record of the Prime 
Broker Arrangement and the required 
acknowledgement from its PB 
Counterparty until the expiration or 
termination of all Permitted PB 
Transactions executed pursuant to the 
Prime Broker Arrangement, and for five 
years thereafter, in accordance with the 
SD recordkeeping rule, § 23.203.
165
 
b. Comments Received and Final Rule 
Only the ISDA/SIFMA Letter 
specifically addressed the proposed 
definition of ‘‘Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangement.’’ ISDA/SIFMA 
recommended two changes to the 
definition as discussed below. 
First, ISDA/SIFMA recommended that 
the definition be changed to clarify that 
the pre-trade disclosures required by the 
definition would not include the price 
of a swap (as proposed by the 
Commission) but also would not 
include the material economic terms of 
a swap, arguing that, like the price, the 
material economic terms of a particular 
swap are negotiated by the PB customer 
with its executing counterparty without 
the knowledge of the SD/PB. The 
Commission agrees that an SD/PB 
would not know the exact economic 
terms of a swap prior to execution, even 
if it has agreed with a PB customer on 
all of the possible permutations of the 
terms that could be agreed and provided 
all required disclosures, to the best of 
the SD/PBs knowledge and reasonable 
belief.
166
Thus, the Commission has 
determined to make the recommended 
change to the definition of Qualified 
Prime Broker Arrangement, as reflected 
in the final rule text infra. 
Second, ISDA/SIFMA recommended 
that the Commission delete the 
requirement that an SD/PB obtain an 
acknowledgement from its PB customers 
acknowledging receipt of the Regulatory 
Disclosures and also delete the 
requirement that an SD/PB retain a 
record of such acknowledgement and 
the Qualified Prime Broker Arrangement 
with each PB customer. ISDA/SIFMA 
argued that an SD/PB is already 
required by the Commission’s SD 
recordkeeping rules to keep records of 
all of agreements entered into as part of 
its business of dealing in swaps and 
thus the recordkeeping proposal was 
redundant.
167
The Commission agrees 
that the recordkeeping proposal would 
be redundant with the Commission’s 
recordkeeping rules for SDs and has 
thus determined to delete that portion of 
the Proposal, as reflected in the final 
rule text infra. For similar reasons, the Commission has determined to accept 
ISDA/SIFMA’s recommendation that the 
Commission delete the requirement that 
an SD/PB obtain an acknowledgement 
from its PB Customers regarding the 
delivery of the Regulatory Disclosures 
and the SD/PBs obligations related 
thereto. As explained by ISDA/SIFMA, 
the acknowledgement requirement 
would entail a costly and burdensome 
exercise to amend or supplement 
existing documentation with each PB 
Customer without any concomitant 
benefit. ISDA/SIFMA argue that SDs are 
already required to keep full and 
complete records of its business of 
dealing in swaps, including all 
correspondence with customers and 
counterparties.
168
Thus, the 
Commission is confident that an SD/PB 
is required to keep adequate records of 
providing its PB customers with the 
Regulatory Disclosures required under 
the definition of Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangement and of the Prime Broker 
Arrangement itself under currently 
existing recordkeeping requirements in 
the Commission’s Regulations and has 
determined to delete the 
acknowledgement requirement as 
reflected in the final rule text infra. 
E. Amendments to § 23.402 
In general, § 23.402 (General 
provisions) requires or allows Swap 
Entities to (a) have written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to 
ensure compliance with the External 
Business Conduct Standards; (b) obtain 
‘‘know-your-counterparty’’ (‘‘KYC’’) 
information about their swap 
counterparties; (c) reasonably rely on 
representations obtained from their 
swap counterparties; (d) agree with 
counterparties on how information 
required to be obtained or disclosed to 
swap counterparties will be 
communicated; and (e) comply with 
recordkeeping requirements.
169
 
1. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.402 by adding a new paragraph (h) 
thereto that would state ‘‘Paragraph (b) 
and (c) of this section shall not apply to 
an ITBC Swap.’’
170
This proposed 
amendment makes clear that because 
ITBC Swaps are executed with 
counterparties with the intention to be 
cleared (and are generally void ab initio 
if such swaps fail to clear), there is no 
ongoing relationship between the Swap 
Entity and the counterparties for which 
the KYC or true name and owner 
provisions of § 23.402 serve a regulatory 
purpose.
171
Specifically, because ITBC 
Swaps, once cleared, result in a new 
swap between the DCO or Exempt DCO 
and the swap counterparty, the 
Commission stated in the Proposed Rule 
that it preliminarily believes that it may 
reasonably rely on the rules of such 
clearinghouses and the regulations 
applicable to FCMs to ensure that swap 
counterparties are adequately vetted for 
KYC purposes.
172
Additionally, because 
some ITBC Swaps may be A–ITBC 
Swaps, Swap Entities will not know,

178
The Commission notes that, pursuant to 
section 2(e) of the CEA, non-ECPs may execute 
swaps that are listed on a DCM, but not on a SEF, 
see 7 U.S.C. 2(e). Commission regulation 37.702, 17 CFR 37.702, requires a SEF to verify that its 
members are ECPs. Similarly, CME Rule 90005.C 
requires Clearing Members (e.g., FCMs) to obtain a representation from each Participant for which it 
provides clearing services that such Participant is, 
and will be, an ECP at all times clearing services 
are provided. 
179
See 17 CFR 23.431. 180
17 CFR 23.431(c). 
181
For the avoidance of doubt, this exclusion 
includes only those material characteristics of a 
particular swap that are expressly reflected in such 
transaction documentation and not, for example, 
the material risks or conflicts of interest that the 
particular swap may present.

See Proposed Rule, 90 FR at 47147–47148. 183

swap counterparty, making it 
impossible to comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of § 23.402 that the Commission 
proposed to be disapplied.
173
 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
The Commission received no specific 
comments with respect to the proposed 
amendment to § 23.402. Thus, the 
Commission is adopting this 
amendment as proposed as shown in 
the final rule text, infra. 
F. Amendments to § 23.430 
In general, § 23.430 (Verification of 
counterparty eligibility) requires Swap 
Entities to: (a) verify the ECP status of 
each swap counterparty; (b) verify 
whether a swap counterparty is a 
Special Entity (as defined in § 23.401); 
and (c) notify swap counterparties of 
any right to elect to be a Special Entity 
available under the definition of Special 
Entity in § 23.401(c)(6).
174
Paragraph (e) 
of § 23.430 provides that these 
verifications and notice requirements 
will not apply to swaps initiated on a 
DCM or, where the Swap Entity does 
not know the identity of the 
counterparty prior to execution, a 
SEF.
175
 
1. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.430(e) by adding an additional 
provision stating that the verification 
and notice requirements will not apply 
to A–ITBC Swaps or to ITBC Swaps that 
are initiated on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt 
SEF.
176
As discussed in the Proposal, 
this amendment would make clear that 
because ITBC Swaps are executed with 
counterparties with the intention to be 
cleared (and are generally void ab initio 
if such swaps fail to clear), there is no 
ongoing relationship between the 
relevant Swap Entity and the 
counterparties.
177
Like for KYC 
purposes discussed above, the 
Commission stated its preliminary belief 
that it may reasonably rely on the rules 
of relevant clearinghouses, SEFs, and 
Exempt SEFs and the DCO rules 
applicable to FCMs as clearing members 
to ensure that swap counterparties are 
adequately vetted for ECP status.
178
The 
Commission also added that, with 
regard to A–ITBC Swaps, Swap Entities 
will not know, and may never know, the 
identity of the swap counterparty, 
making it impossible to comply with the 
verification and notification 
requirements of § 23.430. 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
The Commission received no specific 
comments with respect to the proposed 
amendment to § 23.430. Thus, the 
Commission is adopting this 
amendment as proposed as shown in 
the rule text, infra. 
G. Amendments to § 23.431 
In general, § 23.431 requires Swap 
Entities to: (a) disclose to non-Swap 
Entity counterparties the material risks, 
characteristics, incentives, and conflicts 
of interest of any swap prior to entering 
into the swap; (b) provide the pre-trade 
price and the PTMMM of a swap to a 
non-Swap Entity counterparty prior to 
entering into the swap; (c) provide a 
scenario analysis of a swap if requested 
by a non-Swap Entity counterparty prior 
to entering into the swap; (d) provide 
non-Swap Entity counterparties that 
enter into cleared swaps with the Swap 
Entity with notice of the counterparty’s 
right to receive, upon request, the daily 
mark for such cleared swaps from the 
appropriate DCO; and (e) provide the 
daily mark of an executed uncleared 
swap to a non-Swap Entity counterparty 
to such swap as of each business day 
from the execution of the swap to its 
expiration or termination.
179
Paragraph 
(c) of § 23.431 provides that the pre- 
trade disclosure obligations of 
§§ 23.431(a) and (b) will not apply to 
transactions that are initiated on a DCM 
or SEF where the Swap Entity does not 
know the identity of the counterparty 
prior to execution.
180
 
1. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.431 by: (1) eliminating the PTMMM 
requirement as discussed in Section 
II.A. above; (2) eliminating the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement as discussed in 
Section II.B. above; (3) clarifying that a 
Swap Entity is not required to disclose 
to its counterparty information relating 
to the material characteristics of a 
particular swap to the extent that such 
characteristics are reflected in 
transaction documents that the 
counterparty has been provided prior to 
entering into the swap;
181
(4) expanding 
the exception for pre-trade disclosures 
in paragraph (c) to include: (i) swaps 
executed anonymously on an Exempt 
SEF; (ii) A–ITBC Swaps; (iii) ITBC 
Swaps executed on a DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF; and (iv) permitted PB 
Transactions entered into pursuant to a 
Qualified Prime Broker Arrangement, as 
discussed in Section II.D.5. above; (5) 
adding a new paragraph (2) to 
§ 23.431(d) (Daily mark) that would 
disapply the notice required to be given 
to cleared swap counterparties of the 
right to receive a daily mark from the 
clearing DCO for ITBC Swaps executed 
on a DCM, SEF or Exempt SEF and for 
any A–ITBC Swap; (6) revising the 
uncleared daily mark requirement in 
§ 23.431(d)(2) (renumbered as proposed 
to be (d)(3)) as discussed in Section II.C. 
above; and (7) revising § 23.431(d)(3)(ii) 
(renumbered as proposed to be (d)(4)(ii)) 
to make clear that a Swap Entity may 
disclose to its non-Swap Entity 
counterparties that the daily mark 
provided to the counterparty each 
business day for existing swaps is an 
estimate only.
182
 
The Proposal stated that these 
proposed amendments reflected the 
Commission’s preliminary view that: (1) 
ITBC Swaps (including A–ITBC Swaps) 
are only swaps executed by a 
counterparty with the present intention 
to clear the swap and thus the 
counterparty has no need to receive 
notice of a right to receive a daily mark 
from the Swap Entity because the 
counterparty will face a clearing house; 
(2) Swap Entities do not know the 
identity of their counterparties to A– 
ITBC Swaps prior to execution; (3) 
swaps may be executed by Swap 
Entities on or pursuant to the rules of 
Exempt SEFs and may clear swaps, if 
eligible, on Exempt DCOs; (4) swaps 
accepted for clearing on a DCO or 
Exempt DCO (especially those also 
listed for trading on DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF) are sufficiently 
standardized and information about the 
material risks and characteristics of 
such swaps are available from the DCO 
or Exempt DCO (and/or a DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF, if traded there); and (5) the 
disclosure of information relating to 
material characteristics of a particular 
swap that are reflected in the 
transaction documentation for that swap 
would be duplicative.

Other than comments regarding the 
elimination of the PTMMM 
Requirement, the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement, the daily mark 
requirement, and the exceptions for 
ITBC Swaps and Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangements discussed in Section II A, 
B, C, and D above, the Commission did 
not receive any substantive comments 
on the proposed amendments to 
Commission Regulation § 23.431. Thus, 
other than the changes discussed in 
Section II A, B, C, and D above, the 
Commission is adopting the Proposed 
amendments to § 23.431 as proposed as 
reflected in the final rule text infra. 
H. Amendments to § 23.432 
In general, § 23.432 currently requires 
Swap Entities to provide notice to their 
non-Swap Entity counterparties that the 
counterparty has the right to elect to 
clear a swap executed with the Swap 
Entity (assuming the swap is eligible for 
clearing on a DCO) and has the right to 
choose the DCO on which the swap will 
be cleared, if eligible.
184
 
1. Proposal 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
proposed to amend § 23.432(a) and (b) 
by making clear that the notice must be 
given prior to entering into a swap. The 
Commission further proposed to amend 
§ 23.432 by adding a new paragraph (c) 
that would disapply the notice 
requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) to 
ITBC Swaps executed on a DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF and to all A–ITBC 
Swaps.
185
 
The Proposed Rule noted that this 
proposed amendment reflected the 
Commission’s preliminary view that: (1) 
ITBC Swaps are only those where the 
counterparty has the present intention 
to clear the swap prior to execution and 
thus has no need to receive notice of a 
right to clear the swap or choose the 
clearinghouse; and (2) Swap Entities do 
not know the identity of their 
counterparties to A–ITBC Swaps prior 
to execution.
186
 
2. Comments Received & Final Rule 
The Commission received no 
comments with respect to the proposed 
amendment. Thus, the Commission is 
adopting the proposed amendments to 
§ 23.432(a) and (b) to clarify that the 
notice must be given prior to entering 
into a swap; and is adding a new 
paragraph (c) that disapplies the notice 
requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) to 
ITBC Swaps executed on a DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF and to all A–ITBC Swaps 
as reflected in the final rule text infra. 
I. Amendments to § 23.434 
In general, § 23.434 currently requires 
SDs that recommend a swap or a swap 
trading strategy to a non-Swap Entity 
counterparty to have a reasonable basis 
to believe that such swap or swap 
trading strategy is suitable for the 
counterparty after engaging in 
reasonable diligence to ascertain the 
counterparty’s investment strategy, 
trading objective, and ability to absorb 
potential losses.
187
 
However, § 23.434(b) currently also 
provides a safe harbor, which, if 
complied with, deems the SD to have a 
reasonable basis to believe that the 
recommended swap or swap trading 
strategy is suitable for the 
counterparty.
188
The safe-harbor 
requires the SD to obtain a 
representation from its counterparty 
stating that the counterparty has 
complied in good faith with written 
policies and procedures that are 
reasonably designed to ensure that the 
persons responsible for evaluating any 
recommendation from an SD, and 
making trading decisions on behalf of 
the counterparty, are capable of doing 
so. This safe-harbor representation with 
respect to SD swap recommendations 
was incorporated into an industry-wide 
ISDA protocol in 2012.
189
By adherence 
to the ISDA protocol, counterparties to 
SDs incorporated the safe-harbor 
representation into the swap trading 
relationship documentation that such 
counterparties have entered into with 
each other entity that has also adhered 
to the ISDA protocol. To date, over 
32,000 entities have adhered to the 
ISDA protocol.
190
 
1. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.434 to add a new paragraph (d) that 
would provide an exception from the 
requirements of § 23.434 for A–ITBC 
Swaps and for ITBC Swaps executed by 
an SD with a non-Swap Entity on a 
DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF.
191
In making 
the Proposal, the Commission noted its 
preliminary determinations that (i) in 
light of the tremendous uptake of the 
ISDA protocol reference above, all or 
nearly all SD counterparties have made 
the representation that they will 
independently evaluate any 
recommendation received from an SD 
and are capable of doing so; (ii) swaps 
listed for trading on a DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF, and accepted for clearing 
on a DCO or Exempt DCO, are 
sufficiently standardized, and sufficient 
information about the pricing and 
material risks and characteristics of 
such swaps are available from the DCM, 
SEF, or Exempt SEF and/or the DCO or 
Exempt DCO; (iii) because (x) this 
information is available to 
counterparties from sources other than 
an SD counterparty; (y) ITBC Swap 
counterparties have no on-going 
relationship with an SD counterparty 
with respect to ITBC Swaps; and (z) the 
Commission’s view that all or nearly all 
ITBC Swap counterparties have 
represented to any potential SD 
counterparty that they are capable of 
independently evaluating any 
recommendation from the SD, ITBC 
Swap counterparties will likely look to 
SDs only for competitive pricing.
192
 
Thus, the Proposed Rule expressed the 
Commission’s belief that requiring an 
SD to have a reasonable basis to believe 
that a recommended swap or swap 
trading strategy is suitable for its ITBC 
Swap counterparties is unnecessary 
where adequate information about the 
risks and characteristic of an ITBC Swap 
is available to the counterparty from 
sources other than the SD and the 
suitability analysis otherwise required is 
a hinderance to the efficient trading of 
ITBC Swaps for both the SD and its 
counterparty. Further, the Proposal 
noted that SDs that are counterparties to 
A–ITBC swaps do not know, and may 
never know, the identity of their 
counterparties, making a suitability 
analysis impossible.
193
 
2. Comments Received & Final Rule 
The Commission received no 
comments with respect to the proposed 
amendments to § 23.434. Therefore, the 
Commission is adopting the proposed 
amendments to § 23.434 by adding a 
new paragraph (d) that provides an 
exception from the requirements of 
§ 23.434 for A–ITBC Swaps and for 
ITBC Swaps executed on a DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF as reflected in the final 
rule text infra. 
J. Amendments to § 23.440 and 23.450 
In general, §§ 23.440 and 23.450 
currently concern requirements that SDs 
must comply with when acting as 
advisors to, and Swap Entities must 
comply with when entering into swaps 
with, Special Entities.

In addition to needing to know the identity of 
the counterparty to comply with regulatory 
requirements, an SD would not likely execute a 
swap on an anonymous basis unless the swap is 
intended to be cleared because the SD would not 
know the credit quality of the anonymous 
counterparty and therefore would not know how to 
price the swap or set other material terms for the 
uncleared, bilateral swap, such as margin levels or 
default provisions.

or political subdivision of a State; (3) 
any employee benefit plan subject to 
Title I of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 
1002); (4) any governmental plan, as 
defined in section 3 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(29 U.S.C. 1002); (5) any endowment, 
including an endowment that is an 
organization described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)); or (6) any 
employee benefit plan defined in 
section 3 of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 
1002), not otherwise defined as a 
Special Entity, that elects to be a Special 
Entity by notifying a swap entity of its 
election prior to entering into a swap 
with the particular swap entity. 
Pursuant to §§ 23.440 and 23.450,
196
 
Swap Entities that enter into swaps 
with, or that advise, Special Entities 
owe heightened duties to the Special 
Entity intended to ensure that swaps or 
swap trading strategies recommended 
by an SD to the Special Entity are in the 
best interests of the Special Entity;
197
or 
that, in acting as a counterparty to the 
Special Entity, the Swap Entity has a 
reasonable basis to believe that the 
Special Entity has a representative that 
satisfies the requirements of § 23.450(b) 
(a ‘‘Qualified Independent 
Representative’’ or ‘‘QIR’’).
198
 
However, each of §§ 23.440 and 
23.450 provides a safe harbor, which, if 
complied with, deems the SD to not be 
acting as an advisor to a Special Entity 
and/or have a reasonable basis to 
believe that the Special Entity has a 
QIR.
199
The safe-harbors require the SD 
to obtain certain representations from its 
Special Entity counterparties that were 
incorporated into an industry-wide 
ISDA protocol in 2012.
200
By adherence 
to the ISDA protocol, Special Entity 
counterparties to SDs incorporated the 
safe-harbor representations into the 
swap trading relationship 
documentation that such counterparties 
may have with each other entity that has 
also adhered to the ISDA protocol. As 
noted above, over 32,000 entities have 
adhered to the ISDA protocol,
201
so the 
Commission believes that all or nearly 
all SD Special Entity counterparties 
have made the representations that 
allow SDs to rely on the safe-harbors 
under §§ 23.440 and 23.450. 
1. § 23.440 Proposal, Comments 
Received, and Final Rule 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.440 by adding a new paragraph (e), 
which would provide an exception from 
the requirements of § 23.440 in two 
circumstances.
202
First, the proposed 
amendment would provide an exception 
from the requirements of § 23.440 for A– 
ITBC Swaps (i.e., ITBC Swaps executed with a Special Entity whose identity is 
not known to an SD prior to 
execution).
203
Second, the proposed 
amendment provided an exception from 
the requirements of § 23.440 only for 
ITBC Swaps initiated by a Special Entity 
on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF whose 
identity is known to an SD prior to 
execution, but whose status as a Special 
Entity is not known to the SD.
204
 
Section 4s(h)(4)(B) of the CEA 
provides that an SD that acts as an 
advisor to a Special Entity shall have a 
duty to act in the best interests of the 
Special Entity.
205
However, section 
4s(h)(7) of the CEA provides an 
exception to this duty where a swap is 
initiated by a Special Entity on a DCM 
or a SEF and the SD does not know the 
identity of the counterparty to the 
transaction.
206
In the Proposal, the 
Commission stated that this exception 
reflects Congressional intent to facilitate 
trading of cleared swaps on DCMs and 
SEFs in keeping with the G20 Leaders’ 
Statement from the 2009 Pittsburgh 
Summit, committing its members to 
improving the OTC derivatives markets 
by, among other things, ensuring that 
standardized derivative contracts are 
traded on exchanges or electronic 
trading platforms, where appropriate, 
and cleared through central 
counterparties.
207
Although section 
4s(h)(7) of the CEA does not refer to 
clearing, it would be almost impossible 
for an SD to comply with its post-trade 
risk management and regulatory 
obligations for uncleared swaps if it 
does not know the identity of its 
counterparty prior to execution.
208
For 
example, the SD would need to ensure 
that it had appropriate documentation 
with the counterparty in place to 
comply with the STRD Requirement
209
 
and appropriate documentation and 
information about its counterparty to 
comply with the Commission’s 
uncleared swap margin requirements.
210
 
Thus by default, any swap executed 
under the statutory exception would 
likely be intended to be cleared because 
the swap is anonymous.
211
 
In applying this interpretation of the 
exception in section 4s(h)(7) of the CEA, 
the Commission incorporated a similar 
exception to certain other External 
Business Conduct Standards for swaps 
initiated on a DCM or SEF where a 
Swap Entity does not know the identity 
of its counterparty prior to execution,
212
 
again to facilitate the trading of cleared 
swaps on DCMs and SEFs.
213
This 
exception allows counterparties to seek 
competitive pricing on standardized 
swaps that will be cleared from any 
willing counterparty on exchanges or 
electronic trading platforms without 
being tied to seeking pricing only from 
SDs with whom such counterparties 
have established a trading 
relationship.
214
 
Thus, to further facilitate the trading 
of cleared swaps on DCMs, SEFs, and 
Exempt SEFs, in the context of ITBC 
Swaps initiated by a Special Entity on 
a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF, in the 
Proposal the Commission preliminarily 
interpreted the condition in section 
4s(h)(7) that the SD does not know the 
identity of the counterparty to be met 
not only where the SD is unaware of the 
name of the counterparty (i.e., 
anonymous trading), but also where the 
SD is unaware of the status of the 
counterparty as a Special Entity, even if 
it knows the name of the counterparty. 
The Commission is adopting that 
interpretation in this Final Rule and 
considers that interpretation of 
‘‘identity’’ as reasonable in the context 
of ITBC Swaps initiated by a Special 
Entity on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF

218
In the Proposal, the Commission noted that 
while compliance by an SD with the STRD 
Requirement would almost certainly entail a 
counterparty’s self-identification as a Special 
Entity, the Commission believes that it is possible 
that some SDs may have entered into a trading 
relationship with a Special Entity that does not 
entail documentation that meets the STRD 
Requirement but still requires the counterparty to 
self-identify as a Special Entity, such as where the 
SD and Special Entity have agreed to only enter into 
cleared swaps. 
because the Commission believes that 
this exception will facilitate trading of 
cleared swaps on exchanges or 
electronic platforms both generally and 
by Special Entities. In addition, for the 
reasons discussed above regarding the 
availability of information regarding the 
risks and characteristics of ITBC Swaps 
from sources other than an SD 
counterparty and the lack of any 
ongoing relationship with a 
counterparty to a cleared swap, the 
Commission believes that Special 
Entities initiating swaps on a DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF that are intended to be 
cleared would only be seeking 
competitive pricing from any willing 
counterparty. The initiating Special 
Entity cannot be entering into the ITBC 
Swap in reliance on the advice or 
recommendation of a particular SD that 
may be the willing counterparty 
providing the most competitive price if 
the SD does not even know the 
counterparty is a Special Entity. In other 
words, where a Special Entity is 
initiating an ITBC Swap on a DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF, it is not concerned with 
the identity of its counterparty, and, in 
turn, its counterparty cannot possibly be 
providing advice to the Special Entity if 
it does not know the nature of the 
counterparty as a Special Entity. Thus, 
for purposes of the application of the 
duty imposed on SDs under section 
4s(h)(4)(B) of the CEA to act in the best 
interests of a Special Entity when 
providing trading advice or a swap 
trading recommendation, the only 
salient aspect of the identity of a 
counterparty that initiates an ITBC 
Swap on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF 
is whether the counterparty is in fact a 
known Special Entity. Where an SD has 
no actual knowledge that an ITBC Swap 
counterparty that initiates an ITBC 
Swap on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF 
is, in fact, a Special Entity, the 
Commission believes that such SD 
should not be deemed to know the 
‘‘identity’’ of the counterparty to the 
transaction. 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
noted that the exception in section 
4s(h)(7) of the CEA applies only to 
swaps ‘‘initiated by a Special Entity’’ on 
a DCM or SEF.
215
This language is 
incorporated into the exception in the 
amendment to § 23.440(e)(3) to better 
track the exception provided in the 
CEA, but the Commission has 
determined that ‘‘initiated by’’ has no 
special meaning in this context and is 
synonymous with ‘‘entered into by’’ or 
‘‘executed by.’’
216
The Commission 
understands that taking the active step 
of trading swaps on DCMs, SEFs, or 
Exempt SEFs may take many forms such 
as posting a request-for-quote, 
submitting a bid or offer to a central 
limit order book, or accepting a standing 
or resting bid or offer submitted by 
another market participant to a central 
limit order book.
217
The Commission 
has determined that limiting the 
proposed exception in proposed 
§ 23.440(e)(3) to only a subset of the 
variety of available trading 
methodologies (i.e., only those trading methodologies that the Commission has 
determined would constitute ‘‘initiation 
by’’ a Special Entity) would 
unnecessarily introduce complex 
trading limitations that may require 
material and costly changes to exchange 
trading programming or processes. The 
Commission believes, therefore, that 
‘‘initiated by’’ only means that a market 
participant is conducting trading on a 
DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF for its own 
account or through a duly authorized 
agent. 
In the Proposal, the Commission also 
noted certain limited situations where 
actual knowledge of a counterparty’s 
status as a Special Entity could be 
imputed to an SD under certain 
circumstances. The Commission 
received one comment from ISDA/ 
SIFMA arguing that imputing 
knowledge of a counterparty’s Special 
Entity status was neither reasonable nor 
practical given that trading on a DCM, 
SEF, or Exempt SEF, by definition, is 
intended to provide access to liquidity 
from multiple liquidity providers 
through competitive processes to arrive 
at the best pricing available without 
regard to the ‘‘identity’’ of the 
counterparty. ISDA/SIFMA further 
argued that counterparties initiating a 
trade for an ITBC Swap are often 
represented through an abbreviated 
identifier (rather than a full, legal name) 
and that transactions can take place 
within seconds or less, making 
identification of a counterparty’s 
Special Entity status impracticable if not 
impossible. Given these circumstances 
and the fact that trading venues do not 
offer special flags for Special Entities, 
ISDA/SIFMA’s comment letter 
supported the Commission providing an 
exception from § 23.440 for all ITBC 
Swaps executed on a DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF without regard to a 
counterparty’s status as a Special Entity 
to further the Commission’s goal of 
facilitating the trading of cleared swaps. 
While mindful of commenters’ views 
that the Commission should seek to 
facilitate the competitive trading of 
cleared swaps on DCMs, SEFs, and 
Exempt SEFs to the maximum extent 
possible, the Commission is also 
mindful of the requirement in section 
4s(h)(7) of the CEA that an exception to 
the duty to act in the best interests of 
a Special Entity only be provided where 
an SD does not know the identity of its 
counterparty. Thus, in keeping with the 
Commission’s interpretation of 
‘‘identity’’ discussed above, the 
Commission has determined that a 
broad exception from the requirements 
of § 23.440 should be provided so long 
as an SD has no actual knowledge of 
whether a counterparty is a Special 
Entity. The Commission has also 
determined that such actual knowledge 
will not be imputed and, in the 
Commission’s view, an SD will only 
have such actual knowledge if it has 
entered into a trading relationship with 
such counterparty and has, for example, 
entered into documentation in 
compliance with the STRD 
Requirement.
218
For the avoidance of 
doubt, in no event will an SD be 
deemed to have actual knowledge of a 
counterparty’s status as a Special Entity 
where an SD’s knowledge of a 
counterparty’s identity is solely based 
on a trading venue’s use of an 
abbreviated identifier to represent the 
counterparty. 
Where an SD has entered into trading 
relationship documentation with a 
Special Entity, the Commission believes 
that the tremendous uptake of 
adherence to the ISDA protocol 
discussed above means that it is almost 
impossible that such Special Entity has 
not made the representations necessary 
for an SD to rely on the safe-harbor in 
§ 23.440(b). Because in almost all cases 
the requirements for reliance on the 
safe-harbor in § 23.440(b) will have been 
met, an SD would be free to trade with 
any Special Entity participating on any 
DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF without 
concern that the SD will be found to be 
acting as an advisor to such Special 
Entity and thus no exception from the 
requirements of § 23.440 is needed. 
Other than the comments from ISDA/ 
SIFMA discussed above, the 
Commission received no comments 
with respect to the proposed 
amendments to § 23.440 and is adopting

the amendments as proposed as

2. § 23.450 Proposal, Comments 
Received, and Final Rule 
The Commission also proposed to 
amend § 23.450 to add a new paragraph 
(h) to § 23.450, which would provide an 
exception from the requirements of 
§ 23.450 for A–ITBC Swaps (i.e., swaps with a counterparty whose identity is 
not known to the Swap Entity prior to 
execution), and also provide an 
exception from the requirements of the 
section for any ITBC Swaps entered into 
by a Swap Entity with a Special Entity 
initiated on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt 
SEF.
219
 
As discussed in the Proposal, the 
Commission believes that the proposed 
amendments to § 23.450 better serve the 
intent of the CEA than the rules now in 
effect.
220
As discussed above in relation 
to § 23.434, the Commission has 
determined that swaps listed for trading 
on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF, and 
accepted for clearing on a DCO or 
Exempt DCO, are sufficiently 
standardized and information about the 
material risks and characteristics of 
such swaps are available from the DCM, 
SEF, or Exempt SEF and/or the DCO or 
Exempt DCO. Because (i) this 
information is available to 
counterparties from sources other than a 
Swap Entity counterparty, (ii) ITBC 
Swap counterparties have no on-going 
relationship with a Swap Entity 
counterparty with respect to ITBC 
Swaps, and (iii) all or nearly all ITBC 
Swap counterparties have represented 
to any Swap Entity counterparty that 
they will not rely on recommendations 
from a Swap Entity and/or that any such 
recommendation will be independently 
evaluated by a fiduciary or a QIR, the 
Commission has determined that ITBC 
Swap counterparties will likely be 
entering into ITBC Swaps on DCMs, 
SEFs, or Exempt SEFs on their own 
initiative rather than looking to SDs for 
trading advice or disclosures and likely 
looking to SDs only for competitive 
pricing. Because information about the 
material risks and characteristics of 
ITBC Swaps is available to Special 
Entity counterparties from a source 
other than a Swap Entity, the 
Commission has also determined that it 
is likely that there is no material 
regulatory purpose served by requiring 
an SD to determine that a Special Entity 
counterparty has a QIR. Further, Swap 
Entities that are counterparties to A– 
ITBC swaps or ITBC Swaps with 
counterparties where the Swap Entity 
does not know the Special Entity status 
of the counterparty do not know, and 
may never know, the ‘‘identity’’ (as 
interpreted by the Commission as 
discussed above) of their counterparties, 
making a suitability analysis or 
determination that a Special Entity has 
a QIR impossible.
221
 
In the Proposal, the Commission also 
proposed to amend the definition of the 
term ‘‘statutory disqualification’’ in 
§ 23.450(a)(2).
222
This definition 
constitutes a condition to a person 
acting as a QIR for a Special Entity 
pursuant to § 23.450(b)(1)(ii).
223
The 
Commission proposed to amend the 
definition of ‘‘statutory 
disqualification,’’ and therefore the 
condition to acting as a QIR, as follows, 
with proposed new language italicized: 
The term ‘‘statutory disqualification’’ 
means, with respect to a person that is not a registrant with the Commission, 
grounds for refusal to register or to 
revoke, condition, or restrict the 
registration of any registrant or 
applicant for registration as set forth in 
sections 8a(2) and 8a(3) of the Act, and, 
with respect to a person that is a 
registrant or an applicant for 
registration with the Commission, the 
Commission has refused registration or 
revoked, conditioned, or restricted the 
registration of such registrant or 
applicant for registration pursuant to 
sections 8a(2) or 8a(3) of the Act. 
In the Proposal, the Commission 
stated that the foregoing proposed 
amendment to § 23.450(a)(2)
224
was 
intended to address the fact that many 
entities acting as QIRs for Special 
Entities are registered with the 
Commission as commodity trading 
advisors (and possibly other types of 
registrants).
225
In the Commission’s 
experience, a minor compliance 
violation by such a person that does not 
result in the Commission taking any 
action to revoke the registration of the 
person may nonetheless result in such 
person being disqualified from acting as 
a QIR for Special Entities because the 
definition of ‘‘statutory disqualification’’ 
in § 23.451(a)(2) only requires that there 
be ‘‘grounds’’ for such 
disqualification.
226
The Commission has 
determined that unless a person that is 
a registrant with the Commission has in 
fact had their registration revoked, 
refused, conditioned, or restricted by 
the Commission, then such registrant 
should continue to qualify as a QIR for 
Special Entities, thereby providing the 
Commission discretion similar to that 
under sections 8a(2) and (3) of the 
CEA.
227
Thus, for example, a violation 
of SEC rules or the securities laws by a 
dual-registrant of both the Commission 
and SEC would not constitute a 
statutory disqualification under this 
section unless the Commission 
determined to revoke, refuse, condition, 
or restrict the registration of such dual- 
registrant.
228
The Commission proposed 
this amendment because the current 
definition of ‘‘statutory disqualification’’ 
subjects QIRs to a higher standard of 
conduct than that applied to 
Commission registrants.
229
With respect 
to regulatory violations by Commission 
registrants, the Commission has 
discretion whether to order revocation 
of registration or some other lesser 
penalty. If, however, that same 
registrant is also acting as a QIR, the 
current definition of ‘‘statutory 
disqualification’’ provides no discretion 
because the mere existence of grounds 
for statutory disqualification 
disqualifies the person from acting as a 
QIR.
230
The Commission has 
determined that where a Commission 
registrant is also acting as a QIR and the 
Commission has determined not to 
revoke the registration of the registrant, 
the person should also be permitted to 
continue to act as a QIR. 
The Commission received no 
comments on its proposed amendments 
to § 23.450 and is adopting them as 
proposed as reflected in the final rule 
text infra. K. Amendments to § 23.451 
In general, § 23.451 currently, subject 
to certain conditions and exceptions, 
prohibits SDs from entering into swaps 
with a governmental Special Entity (as 
defined in § 23.451(a)(3)) within two 
years after any political contribution to 
an official of such governmental Special 
Entity was made by the SD or a covered 
associate (as defined in § 23.451(a)(2)) of 
the SD.

DCM or SEF where the SD does not

prior to execution.
232
 
1. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.451 by revising paragraph (b)(2)(iii) 
to provide that the prohibition will not 
apply to: (1) swaps that are initiated on 
a DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF; and (2) A– 
ITBC Swaps.
233
This proposed 
amendment adds Exempt SEFs to the 
list of trading facilities that qualify for 
the exception, but does not maintain the 
anonymous execution condition for 
swaps that are executed on a DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF. This change made the 
Proposal different from MPD’s no-action 
position in CFTC Staff Letter 23–01, 
which excluded § 23.451 from the ITBC 
Compliance Exceptions.
234
This 
exclusion by MPD in CFTC Staff Letter 
23–01 was a change from its prior no- 
action position in CFTC Staff Letter 13– 
70 where § 23.451 was not excluded.
235
 
For the reasons detailed below, the 
Commission has determined that MPD’s 
reasoning for that change may have been 
incomplete or misinformed. 
In proposing to include § 23.451 in 
the ITBC Swap Compliance Exceptions 
for ITBC Swaps executed on a DCM, 
SEF, or Exempt SEF where the SD 
knows the identity of the counterparty, 
the Commission determined that the 
risk of political contributions 
inappropriately influencing 
governmental Special Entities’ swaps 
trading decisions are substantially 
mitigated by the nature of trading on a 
DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF.
236
Such 
facilities, by definition, provide access 
to liquidity from multiple liquidity 
providers, not a single SD.
237
Execution 
also takes place through competitive 
processes such as order books, multi- 
dealer requests for quote, or similar 
multilateral trading protocols. In 
addition, the Commission understands 
that many DCMs, SEFs, and Exempt 
SEFs prohibit pre-arranged trading and 
limit the extent of pre-execution 
communications. As a result (and as 
stated in the Proposal), the Commission 
believes that, unlike with off-facility, 
bilateral trading, DCMs, SEFs, and 
Exempt SEFs would not enable the sort 
of collusion between officials of a 
governmental Special Entity and SDs 
that have made contributions to those 
officials that § 23.451 is designed to 
prevent.
238
 
In addition, the Commission 
understands from market participants 
that MPD’s observations in CFTC Staff 
Letter 23–01 regarding ‘‘no-trade’’ lists 
and other internal requirements 
designed to prevent or mitigate 
violations of § 23.451 are not 
implemented as simply as MPD may 
have surmised in the context of trading 
on DCMs, SEFs, or Exempt SEFs.
239
The 
Commission is aware that staff guidance 
has, since 2013, discouraged SEFs from 
permitting ‘‘enablement mechanisms’’ 
such as those that, according to market 
participants, would allow an SD to 
enforce a ‘‘no-trade’’ list when trading 
on a SEF.
240
The Commission 
understands that DCMs and Exempt 
SEFs are generally subject to similar 
impartial access obligations. As a result, 
the Commission believes that there may 
be significant impediments to SDs 
enforcing measures to comply with 
§ 23.451 when trading on DCMs, SEFs, 
and Exempt SEFs and thus has 
determined to include § 23.451 in the 
ITBC Swap Compliance Exceptions. 
The amendment to § 23.451 to 
exclude A–ITBC Swaps is intended to 
ensure that all swaps executed 
anonymously, including those not 
initiated, on a DCM, SEF, or Exempt 
SEF, will not be subject to § 23.451.
241
 
The Commission has determined that it 
is not possible for an SD to comply with 
§ 23.451 where an SD does not know the 
identity of the counterparty prior to 
execution, regardless of whether the 
swap is executed bilaterally or on or 
pursuant to the rules of a DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF. 
The Commission also proposed to 
delete the word ‘‘Federal’’ from 
§ 23.451(a)(1)(iii),
242
which defines the 
term ‘‘contribution’’ in relation to 
transition or inaugural expenses for a 
successful candidate for office.
243
 
Commission regulation 23.451 was 
promulgated using the Commission’s 
discretionary rulemaking authority 
under section 4s(h) of the CEA
244
to 
impose business conduct requirements 
in the public interest, and thus the 
Dodd-Frank Act neither required the 
Commission to adopt that regulation nor 
to include Federal inaugural expenses 
within the meaning of 
‘‘contribution.’’
245
Further, the 
Commission intended the rule, among 
other things, to complement existing 
pay-to-play prohibitions imposed by 
Federal securities regulators to deter 
undue influence and other fraudulent 
practices that harm the public and 
promote consistency in the business 
conduct standards that apply to 
financial market professionals dealing 
with municipal entities.
246
However, 
neither of the substantially similar rules 
promulgated by the SEC for security- 
based swap dealers and the Municipal 
Securities Rulemaking Board (‘‘MSRB’’) 
for brokers, dealers, and municipal 
securities dealers include Federal 
election transition or inaugural 
expenses in their definitions of 
‘‘contribution.’’
247
Thus, the 
Commission proposed to delete 
‘‘Federal’’ from § 23.451(a)(1)(iii) to 
better align the rule with the intention 
of the Commission stated in the initial 
rulemaking, which was to complement 
the rules of the SEC and the MSRB.
248
 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
The Commission received no 
comments with respect to the proposed 
amendments to § 23.451. Therefore, the 
Commission is adopting the 
amendments as proposed as reflected in 
the final rule text infra. 
L. Amendment to § 23.504 
In general, § 23.504 currently requires 
Swap Entities to enter into swap trading 
relationship documentation covering 
certain enumerated topics with each 
swap counterparty prior to entering into 
a swap with such counterparty
249
 
(previously defined as the ‘‘STRD 
Requirement’’).
250
 
1. Proposal 
The Commission proposed to amend 
§ 23.504(a)(1) by adding a new 
paragraph (iii). The revised section 
would include the following 
provisions—as to applicability, the 
requirements of the section shall not

apply to: (i) swaps executed prior to the 
date on which a swap dealer or major 
swap participant is required to be in 
compliance with this section; (ii) swaps 
that have been cleared on a derivatives 
clearing organization or cleared on a 
clearing organization that is currently 
exempted from registration by the 
Commission pursuant to section 5b(h) of 
the Act; and (iii) an ITBC Swap as 
defined in § 23.401(d) of 17 CFR chapter 
I. 
As stated in the Proposal, these 
proposed changes recognize that the 
clearing of swaps between a Swap 
Entity and a counterparty involves two 
stages: (1) the execution of a swap 
between a Swap Entity and its 
counterparty; and (2) the novation of 
that swap to a clearing organization that 
results in two swaps: (i) a swap between 
the clearing organization and the Swap 
Entity; and (ii) a swap between the 
clearing organization and its 
counterparty.
251
The proposed changes 
to the applicability of the STRD 
Requirement in § 23.504(a)(1) therefore 
recognize that the STRD Requirement 
should not apply to an ITBC Swap as 
defined in proposed § 23.401(d),
252
 
which is the swap between a Swap 
Entity and its counterparty that is 
intended to be cleared 
contemporaneously with execution (i.e., 
§ 23.504(a)(1)(iii)) because no 
documentation is needed if the swap 
will either be cleared promptly or if not 
cleared, void ab initio.
253
For the same 
reason, the STRD Requirement need not 
apply to the swaps that result from the 
novation of such swap to a clearing 
organization (i.e., § 23.504(a)(1)(ii)). The proposed amendment to 
§ 23.504(a)(1)(ii) also recognizes that a 
swap may be cleared on a DCO or on an 
Exempt DCO.
254
 
2. Comments Received and Final Rule 
The Commission received no 
comments with respect to the proposed 
amendments to § 23.504. As such, the 
Commission is adopting the 
amendments to § 23.504(a)(1) as 
proposed by adding a new subsection 
(iii) as reflected in the final rule text 
infra. 
III. Cost Benefit Considerations 
A. Statutory and Regulatory Background 
As discussed above, section 4s(h) of 
the CEA
255
provides the Commission 
with both mandatory and discretionary 
rulemaking authority to impose 
business conduct standards on Swap 
Entities in their dealings with 
counterparties, including Special 
Entities.
256
Pursuant to this rulemaking 
authority, the Commission adopted the 
External Business Conduct 
Standards.
257
In addition, section 4s(i) 
of the CEA requires the Commission to 
adopt rules governing swap 
documentation for Swap Entities.
258
 
Pursuant to this rulemaking authority, 
the Commission adopted the STRD 
Requirement.
259
 
Under this same authority and as 
discussed above, this Final Rule makes 
certain amendments to the External 
Business Conduct Standards and STRD 
Requirement to, among other things, 
provide exceptions to compliance with 
such requirements when executing 
swaps that are: (1) intended by the 
parties to be cleared contemporaneously 
with execution; or (2) subject to prime 
broker arrangements that meet certain 
qualifying conditions. In addition, the 
Commission is eliminating the PTMMM 
Requirement and the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement in their entirety, amending 
the daily mark requirement under 
§ 23.431(d) to provide Swap Entities 
greater flexibility in determining how to 
calculate daily marks for uncleared 
swaps, and making certain other 
changes discussed above. 
As explained in Section I above, the 
Commission is issuing this Final Rule to 
amend certain business conduct 
standards for Swap Entities contained in 
subpart H of part 23 of the 
Commission’s regulations,
260
and to the 
swap trading relationship 
documentation rule for Swap Entities in 
§ 23.504.
261
As explained in detail in 
Section II.A. through Section II.L. above, 
the amendments are intended to address 
certain long-standing issues with the 
Commission’s external business conduct 
standards and swap trading relationship 
documentation rule, and are intended to 
supersede many long-standing no-action 
positions issued by MPD (i.e., the Covered Staff Letters described in detail 
in Section II.B. above), by codifying 
such positions in the Commission’s 
regulations. 
B. Consideration of the Costs and 
Benefits of the Commission’s Action 
1. Section 15(a) of the CEA 
Section 15(a) of the CEA requires the 
Commission to ‘‘consider the costs and 
benefits’’ of its actions before 
promulgating a regulation under the 
CEA or issuing certain orders.
262
 
Section 15(a) further specifies that the 
costs and benefits shall be evaluated in 
light of the following five broad areas of 
market and public concern: (1) 
protection of market participants and 
the public; (2) efficiency, 
competitiveness, and financial integrity 
of futures markets; (3) price discovery; 
(4) sound risk management practices; 
and (5) other public interest 
considerations (collectively, the 
‘‘Section 15(a) Factors’’).
263
In 
conducting its analysis, the Commission 
may, in its discretion, give greater 
weight to any one of the five 
enumerated areas of concern and may 
determine that, notwithstanding its 
costs, a particular rule is necessary or 
appropriate to protect the public interest 
or to effectuate any of the provisions or 
to accomplish any of the purposes of the 
Act. 
The Commission notes that this cost- 
benefit consideration is based on its 
understanding that the derivatives 
market regulated by the Commission 
functions internationally with: (1) 
transactions that involve U.S. entities 
occurring across different international 
jurisdictions; (2) some entities organized 
outside of the United States that are 
registered with the Commission; and (3) 
some entities that typically operate both 
within and outside the United States 
and that follow substantially similar 
business practices wherever located. 
Where the Commission does not 
specifically refer to matters of location, 
the discussion of costs and benefits 
below refers to the effects of the 
proposed regulations on all relevant 
derivatives activity, whether based on 
their actual occurrence in the United 
States or on their connection with, or 
effect on U.S. commerce.
264
 
Where reasonably feasible, the 
Commission has endeavored to estimate 
quantifiable costs and benefits. Where 
quantification is not feasible, the 
Commission identifies and describes 
costs and benefits qualitatively. The 
Commission acknowledges that it is 
limited in estimating the actual cost of 
the Final Rule. The initial and recurring 
costs for any particular Swap Entity, or 
a counterparty to a Swap Entity, will

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES261247 Federal Register/ Vol. 90, No. 246 / Tuesday, December 30, 2025 / Rules and Regulations 265
The Commission notes that, although the 
Commission is adopting amendments that add 
various new definitions and changes to existing 
definitions in 17 CFR 23.401, the costs and benefits 
of those definitions are discussed in the substantive 
rules in which the new or changed definitions 
appear. 
266
Currently, there are no MSPs registered with 
the Commission and there have not been any MSPs 
registered with the Commission for several years. 
Thus, this Section regarding the Commission’s 
consideration of the costs and benefits of the Final 
Rule will only refer to SDs (not MSPs), a portion 
of which may have relied on the Covered Staff 
Letters.

dealing activity, other business 
activities, practices, and cost structure. 
The Commission did not receive any 
data or comments specifically or 
generally addressing the Commission’s 
cost-benefit analysis in the Proposal. 
2. Costs and Benefits of This Final Rule 
As in the Proposal, the Commission 
identifies and considers the benefits and 
costs of the changes made by this Final 
Rule relative to the baseline of those 
generated by the current statutory and 
regulatory framework applicable to the 
issues addressed by this Final Rule, i.e., 
the current status quo. Specifically, the 
baseline for the Commission’s 
consideration of the costs and benefits 
are those the Commission believes are 
(or would be) realized by Swap Entity 
compliance with: (1) the External 
Business Conduct Standards and (2) the 
STRD Requirement.
265
The Commission 
recognizes, however, that to the extent 
that SDs
266
have arranged their business 
in reliance on MPD no-action positions 
in the Covered Staff Letters, the actual 
costs and benefits may not be as 
significant. 
The Commission requested, both 
generally and with respect to specific 
proposed amendments, and did not 
receive any comments from commenters 
on the baseline. No commenter 
quantified nor attempted to quantify the 
costs and benefits of any part of the 
Proposal. 
a. Benefits 
Compliance with the conditions set 
forth in the definition of ITBC Swap in 
§ 23.401
267
of this Final Rule will 
permit SDs to qualify for exceptions to 
compliance with regulatory 
requirements set forth in final §§ 23.402 
through 23.451 and § 23.504.
268
The 
Commission requested but received no 
information on the number of SDs that 
are currently relying on the MPD no- 
action position for ITBC Swaps in CFTC 
Staff Letter 23–01, although the 
Commission believes that a significant 
number of SDs are participating in the 
market for ITBC Swaps. The 
Commission believes these exceptions 
will benefit such SDs by reducing 
compliance obligations, and thereby 
lowering compliance costs, as well as 
reducing operational costs for SDs 
because such SDs will no longer have to 
agree on disclosure methodologies with 
their ITBC Swap counterparties, nor 
prepare and maintain the actual written 
disclosures. Specifically, the 
Commission believes that its adoption 
of the compliance exceptions in this 
Final Rule for swaps meeting the ITBC 
Swap definition will, without materially 
disadvantaging their non-Swap Entity 
counterparties,
269
significantly reduce 
the number of required disclosures an 
SD is required to make, including 
disclosure pursuant to § 23.431(a) of the 
material risks and characteristics of a 
particular swap, disclosure of material 
incentives and conflicts of interest that 
an SD may have in connection with a 
particular swap, and disclosure of the 
PTMMM of a particular swap.
270
The 
SD may also similarly benefit from the 
elimination of the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement and the disapplication of 
the disclosure requirements regarding a 
counterparty’s right to request clearing 
and choose the DCO on which a swap 
will be cleared under § 23.432.
271
 
Because an SD’s ITBC Swap 
counterparties will not have to make 
arrangements to receive and process the 
various disclosures, such counterparties 
may also benefit from lower legal and 
operational costs. 
The Commission also believes that 
compliance with the conditions set forth 
in the definition of ITBC Swap in final 
§ 23.401 will benefit SDs by permitting 
them to qualify for exceptions to 
compliance with regulatory 
requirements that would otherwise 
require the SD to obtain information and 
representations from their non-Swap 
Entity counterparties, including the 
KYC, ECP, and Special Entity status 
information and representations under 
§§ 23.402 and 23.430
272
and due 
diligence information regarding a 
Special Entity’s QIR under §§ 23.440 
and 23.450.
273
The Commission believes 
these provisions of this Final Rule will 
lower compliance and operational costs 
for SDs. For example, with respect to 
the elimination of the PTMMM 
Requirement, the Commission believes 
that SDs will benefit from a reduction in 
costs that would otherwise be incurred 
in preparing and disclosing the 
PTMMM. Not being required to source 
mid-market prices for certain swaps 
solely for disclosure of a PTMMM to 
non-Swap Entity counterparties may 
result in cost savings for SDs. Further, 
SDs’ ITBC Swap counterparties may 
benefit from lower legal and operational 
costs to the extent they no longer need 
to respond to requests for information 
and representations from SDs that avail 
themselves of the exception. 
However, as noted in the Proposal, as 
a result of the no-action positions 
provided by MPD in CFTC Staff Letter 
23–01 pertaining to ITBC Swaps, CFTC 
Staff Letter 13–12 pertaining to certain 
foreign exchange transactions (e.g., 
swaps and Exempt FX Transactions for 
the 31 most widely-traded currencies), 
and, most recently, CFTC Staff Letter 
25–09, the PTMMM is probably not 
being provided by some SDs to some 
counterparties to cleared and uncleared 
swaps and such foreign exchange 
transactions. Therefore, elimination of 
the PTMMM Requirement may not be 
significant to the cost savings of, or 
benefits to, such SDs or their 
counterparties. 
Similarly, with respect to the 
elimination of the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement, the Commission notes that 
because of the no-action position 
provided by MPD in CFTC Staff Letter 
23–01 pertaining to ITBC Swaps, 
scenario analysis is probably not being 
provided by some SDs to some cleared 
swaps counterparties. Therefore, the 
Commission believes that elimination of 
the Scenario Analysis Requirement may 
not be significant to the costs of, or 
benefits to, such SDs or their 
counterparties. 
Finally, compliance with the ITBC 
Swap conditions in the Final Rule will 
benefit some SDs and their 
counterparties by providing an 
exception to the expensive and time- 
consuming process of negotiating and 
executing swap trading relationship 
documentation under the STRD 
Requirement in cases where the 
documentation is unnecessary. As a 
whole, the exceptions from the 
documentation, onboarding, disclosure, 
and information collection requirements 
may, potentially benefit ITBC Swap 
counterparties by allowing more SDs to 
act as potential counterparties to a 
particular ITBC Swap counterparty, 
providing more liquidity to the cleared 
swaps market as a whole. 
The Commission believes that 
compliance with the conditions set forth 
in the definition of a Qualified Prime

274
of 
the Final Rule will also benefit SDs by 
disapplying the price and other material 
economic terms disclosure requirement 
under § 23.431(a).
275
Further, 
compliance with the Qualified Prime 
Broker Arrangement conditions may 
permit PB/SDs to engage in transactions 
where counterparties to the Trigger 
Transaction and/or Mirror Transaction 
would not be limited to other SDs as is 
the case under MPD’s no-action position 
in CFTC Staff Letter 13–11. The 
Commission expects PB Counterparties 
from the ability to obtain competitive 
pricing from this widened pool of 
potential participants in the markets for 
prime brokerage transactions. 
Regarding the other miscellaneous 
amendments, the amendment to the 
daily mark disclosure requirement in 
§ 23.431 to provide additional flexibility 
to SDs may benefit SDs by reducing 
their operational burdens. The amended 
definition of ‘‘statutory disqualification’’ 
in § 23.450 of the Final Rule will benefit 
those persons not automatically barred 
from being a QIR and may benefit 
certain Special Entities if they are not 
required to find a new QIR in the event 
their existing QIR is subject to a 
regulatory action that would have 
previously constituted a statutory 
disqualification. Finally, certain Swap 
Entities may benefit from the adopted 
amendment to § 23.451 that removes 
‘‘Federal’’ from the definition of 
‘‘contributions’’ under the rule, thereby 
not prohibiting the Swap Entity from 
entering into swaps with Federal 
governmental Special Entities if the 
Swap Entity makes a contribution to the 
transition or inaugural expenses of a 
successful candidate for Federal public 
office. 
b. Costs 
As compared to the baseline of full 
compliance with the current External 
Business Conduct Standards and the 
STRD Requirement prior to adoption of 
the Final Rule, compliance with the 
conditions set forth in the definition of 
ITBC Swap in § 23.401 may entail the 
following costs: 
1. Costs incurred by an SD and its 
ITBC Swap counterparty in determining 
whether counterparties are eligible to 
clear an ITBC Swap on a particular DCO 
or Exempt DCO because determining 
eligibility likely will require a written 
inquiry and receipt of a written 
response and attendant recordkeeping 
processes or entry of response in trading 
systems; 
2. Costs incurred by an SD and its 
ITBC Swap counterparty in ensuring 
that swaps are submitted to clearing on 
a DCO or Exempt DCO as quickly after 
execution as would be technologically 
practicable if fully automated systems 
were used because doing so likely will 
require on-boarding to DCO and/or 
Exempt DCO swap submission systems, 
or to their respective client clearing 
service providers, with attendant 
applications and other paperwork as 
well as recordkeeping processes; 
3. Costs incurred by SDs and their 
ITBC Swap counterparties in adjusting 
execution documentation to ensure 
agreement that swaps not executed on a 
DCM, SEF, or Exempt SEF that fail to 
clear will either (i) be deemed by the SD 
and its counterparty to be void ab initio, 
or (ii) be subject to a breakage agreement 
or similar arrangement; 
4. Costs incurred by SDs and their 
ITBC Swap counterparties in adjusting 
execution documentation to ensure 
agreement that a swap executed on or 
pursuant to the rules of an Exempt SEF 
where the rules of the Exempt SEF do 
not provide for a swap rejected from 
clearing to be deemed void ab initio will 
either (i) be deemed by the SD and its 
counterparty to be void ab initio, or (ii) 
be subject to a breakage agreement or 
similar arrangement. 
The Commission notes that many, if 
not all, of the foregoing costs may have 
already been incurred by SDs to meet 
the conditions to the MPD no-action 
position in CFTC Staff Letter 23–01, 
though the Commission acknowledges 
that at least some additional costs will 
likely be incurred by SDs and their ITBC 
Swap counterparties due to minor 
variations between the Final Rule and 
the conditions set forth in CFTC Staff 
Letter 23–01. 
As compared to the baseline of full 
compliance with the External Business 
Conduct Standards, compliance with 
the conditions set forth in the definition 
of Qualified Prime Broker Arrangement 
in § 23.401 of the Final Rule may entail 
costs incurred by PB/SDs and their new 
PB Counterparties to negotiate and enter 
into Prime Broker Arrangements, and 
costs incurred by PB/SDs and their 
existing PB Counterparties to negotiate 
and amend existing Prime Broker 
Arrangements that meet the conditions 
of the definition of Qualified Prime 
Broker Arrangement, including, costs 
incurred to ensure that the parties have 
agreed on the type, parameters, and 
limits of each potential Covered 
Transaction (as defined in § 23.401)
276
 
that may be entered pursuant to the 
Prime Broker Arrangement. 
3. Costs and Benefits of the 
Commission’s Final Rule as Compared 
to Alternatives 
In addition to the alternatives 
discussed in the Proposal, the 
Commission considered several 
alternatives to portions of this Final 
Rule, which are discussed in detail 
throughout this release.
277
In each 
instance, the Commission considered 
the costs and burdens of this Final Rule 
and the regulatory benefits that the 
Final Rule seeks to achieve in finalizing 
this Final Rule. 
4. Section 15(a) Factors 
Section 15(a) of the CEA
278
requires 
the Commission to consider the effects 
of its actions in light of the following 
five factors discussed below: (a) the 
protection of market participants and 
the public; (b) the efficiency, 
competitiveness, and financial integrity 
of futures markets; (c) price discovery 
considerations; (d) sound risk 
management practices; and (e) other 
public interest considerations. 
a. Protection of Market Participants and 
the Public 
Section 15(a)(2)(A) of the CEA 
requires the Commission to evaluate the 
costs and benefits of a proposed 
regulation in light of considerations of 
protection of market participants and 
the public.
279
The Commission believes 
that the amendments adopted herein 
will maintain the efficacy of protections 
for customers and the broader financial 
system already contained in the 
External Business Conduct Standards 
and the STRD Requirement. 
In general, the External Business 
Conduct Standards were adopted by the 
Commission as directed by the Dodd- 
Frank Act to increase protections for 
counterparties to Swap Entities by 
requiring additional disclosures about 
the material risks and characteristics of 
swaps and the material incentives and 
conflicts of interest that a Swap Entity 
may have to recommend or enter into 
swaps with such counterparties. One 
goal of the External Business Conduct 
Standards was to attempt to balance the 
historical asymmetry of information 
about swaps and the swap markets that 
had existed prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, 
leaving counterparties much less 
informed about the material risks and 
characteristics of swaps and the pricing 
of swaps, and the compensation being

earned by Swap Entities when entering 
into swaps. This Final Rule provides 
regulatory compliance exceptions from 
some of the required disclosures that 
counterparties to Swap Entities would 
otherwise receive. However, for reasons 
described below, the Commission 
believes that it has crafted the 
exceptions in a way to realize important 
benefits while largely preserving the 
level of pricing-information symmetry 
for counterparties. 
In the context of Prime Broker 
Arrangements, the price and other 
material economic terms disclosures are 
disapplied, but such disapplication is 
necessary to allow PB Counterparties to 
seek prices for transactions from a 
variety of potential counterparties while 
maintaining only one or two trading 
relationships with PBs, serving the 
Commission’s interest in robust price 
discovery processes and allowing 
counterparties to benefit from 
operational and collateral netting 
efficiencies. Without the disclosure 
exception for Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangements, PB Counterparties 
seeking prices from a variety of 
potential counterparties would be 
required to forego the credit 
intermediation services provided by PB/ 
SDs and would be required to have 
multiple trading relationships with SDs 
and perhaps non-SDs, with an attendant 
decrease in operational and collateral 
efficiencies. 
In the context of ITBC Swaps, 
additional disclosure requirements and 
relationship-based requirements are 
disapplied in situations when Swap 
Entities enter into ITBC Swaps with 
non-Swap Entity counterparties. 
However, the Commission believes that 
the potential costs associated with the 
disapplication of these regulatory 
requirements (subject to the conditions 
provided for in this Final Rule) are 
justified. First, doing so strongly 
furthers the Commission’s regulatory 
interest in promoting the trading of 
swaps on trading facilities and the 
clearing of swaps generally, two of the 
pillars of the reforms Congress intended 
to be implemented for the swap markets 
by enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
The Commission’s purpose in 
disapplying the disclosure and trading 
relationship requirements in the context 
of ITBC Swaps as set forth in this Final 
Rule
280
is to remove impediments to the 
efficient trading and clearing of swaps. 
Second, the Commission does not 
foresee a significant countervailing cost. 
Because a cleared swap is between a 
counterparty and the DCO or Exempt 
DCO and there is no ongoing 
relationship between a Swap Entity and 
the counterparty, the Commission 
believes that the relationship 
requirements in the External Business 
Conduct Standards and the STRD 
Requirement bear little, if at all, on the 
transaction. Similarly, the Commission 
believes that for a swap to be listed for 
trading on a DCM, SEF, or an Exempt 
SEF and/or cleared by a DCO or Exempt 
DCO, information about that swap is 
necessarily made available to 
counterparties from sources 
independent of Swap Entities, thereby 
limiting the necessity for the disclosures 
otherwise required by the External 
Business Conduct Standards. 
The elimination of the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement could also reduce 
the transparency of swaps transactions 
to swap counterparties. However, those 
analyses are only required when 
requested by a counterparty to the Swap 
Entity, and the Commission 
understands that they are requested 
rarely, if at all, due to their limited 
value. 
For the foregoing reasons, the 
Commission believes that this Final 
Rule will not have a material 
detrimental effect on the protection of 
swap market participants or the public. 
b. Efficiency, Competitiveness, and 
Financial Integrity of Futures Markets 
Section 15(a)(2)(B) of the CEA 
requires the Commission to evaluate the 
costs and benefits of a proposed 
regulation in light of ‘‘efficiency, 
competitiveness, and financial integrity 
of futures markets.’’
281
This Final Rule 
will not directly impact the efficiency, 
competitiveness, or financial integrity of 
futures markets because it relates solely 
to business conduct standards and 
documentation requirements applicable 
to swap market participants. However, 
to the extent the Final Rule disapplies 
and eliminates certain requirements 
otherwise applicable to certain swaps, it 
may encourage some market 
participants to engage in swaps rather 
than futures market transactions, 
thereby potentially reducing the 
competition in futures markets. 
c. Price Discovery 
Section 15(a)(2)(C) of the CEA 
requires the Commission to evaluate the 
costs and benefits of a proposed 
regulation in light of price discovery 
considerations.
282
As discussed above, 
this Final Rule’s provision of regulatory 
compliance exceptions for ITBC Swaps 
and PB/SDs in Qualified Prime Broker 
Arrangements will permit 
counterparties to seek swap prices from 
a wider variety of market participants 
(SDs with whom counterparties have 
trading relationships and those with 
whom they do not, PBs, executing 
dealers, other PB Counterparties, etc.) 
and thus the Commission believes that 
the Final Rule will facilitate more 
efficient swap price discovery for swaps 
intended to be cleared and swaps in the 
markets served by PBs. However, to the 
extent that eliminating the PTMMM 
disclosures imposes higher information 
discovery costs on some market 
participants, this Final Rule could 
hinder competition and price discovery. 
The Commission received no comments 
supporting the continuing availability of 
the PTMMM and thus has determined 
that any hinderance on competition or 
price discovery is immaterial. 
d. Sound Risk Management Practices 
Section 15(a)(2)(D) of the CEA 
requires the Commission to evaluate the 
costs and benefits of a proposed 
regulation in light of sound risk 
management practices.
283
The 
Commission believes that this Final 
Rule will not have a significant effect on 
risk management practices. Specifically, 
the Swap Entity risk management 
requirements under § 23.600
284
and 
other Commission Regulations will not 
change under this Final Rule as it 
relates to ITBC Swaps because, absent 
this Final Rule, a Swap Entity’s risks 
will still relate to cleared swaps (and 
not uncleared swaps) even if the Swap 
Entity were required to make all of the 
required disclosures and comply with 
the relationship, suitability, and 
advisory rules of the External Business 
Conduct Standards. Similarly, the relief 
from disclosure of the price and other 
material economic terms in the context 
of Prime Broker Arrangements will not 
change the required risk management 
processes applicable to PB/SDs. The 
Commission received no comments 
discussing the impact of the Proposal on 
the risk management capabilities of 
counterparties to SDs and thus has 
determined that any hinderance on such 
risk management capabilities is 
immaterial. 
However, to the extent that the Final 
Rule promotes trading on DCMs, SEFs, 
and Exempt SEFs and clearing through 
a DCO or Exempt DCO, the Commission 
believes that the Final Rule may further 
sound risk management practices. The 
trades executed on DCMs, SEFs, and 
Exempt SEFs are subject to the rules of 
these entities’ platforms and receive the 
associated protections. Also, the trades

e. Other Public Interest Considerations 
Section 15(a)(2)(E) of the CEA 
requires the Commission to evaluate the 
costs and benefits of a proposed 
regulation in light of other public 
interest considerations.
286
The 
Commission is identifying a public 
interest benefit in its codification of the 
MPD no-action positions in the Covered 
Staff Letters, as noted herein, where the 
efficacy of those positions has been 
demonstrated. In such a situation, the 
Commission believes it serves the 
public interest and, in particular, the 
interests of market participants, to 
engage in notice-and-comment 
rulemaking and to seek and consider the 
views of the public in amending its 
regulations, rather than for it to allow 
market participants to continue to rely 
on no-action positions that could be 
easily withdrawn or modified by MPD 
at any time, providing less long-term 
certainty for market participants and 
offering a more limited opportunity for 
public input. 
IV. Related Matters 
A. Antitrust Considerations 
Section 15(b) of the CEA requires the 
Commission to take into consideration 
the public interest to be protected by the 
antitrust laws and endeavor to take the 
least anticompetitive means of 
achieving the objectives of the CEA, in 
issuing any order or adopting any 
Commission rule or regulation.
287
 
The Commission believes that the 
public interest to be protected by the 
antitrust laws is generally to protect 
competition. The Commission requested 
and did not receive any comments on 
whether the Proposed Rule implicated 
any other specific public interest to be 
protected by the antitrust laws. 
The Commission has considered this 
Final Rule to determine whether it is 
anticompetitive and has identified no 
anticompetitive effects. The 
Commission requested and did not 
receive any comments on whether the 
Proposed Rule was anticompetitive and, 
if it was, what the anticompetitive 
effects are. 
Because the Commission has 
determined that this Final Rule is not 
anticompetitive and has no significant 
discretionary anticompetitive effects 
and received no comments on its 
determination in the Proposed Rule, the 
Commission has not identified any less 
anticompetitive means of achieving the 
relevant purposes of the CEA. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
(‘‘RFA’’) requires Federal agencies to 
consider whether the rules they propose 
will have a significant economic impact 
on a substantial number of small entities 
and, if so, to provide a regulatory 
flexibility analysis reflecting the 
impact.
288
In the Proposed Rule, the 
Commission certified that the Proposed 
Rule would not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. The 
Commission received no comments 
with respect to the RFA. 
The amendments adopted herein 
affect certain Swap Entities and their 
counterparties, which must be ECPs.
289
 
The Commission has previously 
established certain definitions of ‘‘small 
entities’’ to be used in evaluating the 
impact of its regulations on small 
entities in accordance with the RFA.
290
 
Among those, the Commission has 
previously established that Swap 
Entities and ECPs are not ‘‘small 
entities’’ for purposes of the RFA.
291
 
Accordingly, the Chairman, on behalf of 
the Commission, hereby certifies 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the 
regulations will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
The Paperwork Reduction Act 
(‘‘PRA’’)
292
imposes certain 
requirements on Federal agencies in 
connection with their conducting or 
sponsoring any collection of 
information as defined by the PRA. 
Under the PRA, an agency may not 
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not 
required to respond to, a collection of 
information unless it displays a 
currently valid control number from the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(‘‘OMB’’).
293
The PRA is intended, in 
part, to minimize the paperwork burden 
created for individuals, businesses, and 
other persons as a result of the 
collection of information by federal 
agencies, and to ensure the greatest 
possible benefit and utility of 
information created, collected, 
maintained, used, shared, and 
disseminated by or for the Federal 
Government.
294
The PRA applies to all 
information, regardless of form or 
format, whenever the Federal 
Government is obtaining, causing to be 
obtained, or soliciting information, and 
includes required disclosure to third 
parties or the public, of facts or 
opinions, when the information 
collection calls for answers to identical 
questions posed to, or identical 
reporting or recordkeeping requirements 
imposed on, ten or more persons.
295
 
The Commission will protect 
proprietary information it may receive 
according to the Freedom of Information 
Act and 17 CFR part 145, ‘‘Commission 
Records and Information.’’ In addition, 
section 8(a)(1) of the CEA strictly 
prohibits the Commission, unless 
specifically authorized by the CEA, from 
making public ‘‘data and information 
that would separately disclose the 
business transactions or market 
positions of any person and trade 
secrets or names of customers.’’
296
The 
Commission also is required to protect 
certain information contained in a 
government system of records according 
to the Privacy Act of 1974.
297
 
This final rulemaking affects 
regulations that contain collections of 
information within the meaning of the 
PRA, as discussed below.
298
The titles 
for these collections of information for 
which the Commission has previously 
received two OMB Control Numbers are: 
(1) OMB Control Number 3038–0079 
(Swap Dealer and Major Swap 
Participant Conflicts of Interest and 
Business Conduct Standards with 
Counterparties); and (2) OMB Control 
Number 3038–0088 (Swap 
Documentation). 
This final rulemaking modifies the 
Commission’s burden estimates for the 
information collection requirements 
associated with OMB Control Number 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  17:19 Dec 29, 2025 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00026 Fmt 4701 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\30DER2.SGM 30DER2

Although this Final Rule contains certain 
modifications to the Proposed Rule, as discussed 
above, the Commission does not believe these 
changes impact the PRA analysis in the Proposal. 
Therefore, the Commission is maintaining the 
Proposal’s estimated number of responses, burden 
hours, and frequency of collection.

be covered by existing collections of information 
under OMB Control No. 3038–0087 (Reporting, 
Recordkeeping, and Daily Trading Records 
Requirements for Swap Dealers and Major 
Participants). Accordingly, the Commission is not 
submitting to OMB an information collection

Qualifying Prime Broker Arrangements.

299
The 
Commission submitted these 
information collections for OMB review 
in association with the Proposal, see ICR Ref. No. 202509–3038–001, and OMB 
has approved the modified collections 
contained in this Final Rule, in 
accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 
5 CFR 1320.11(g). 
1. OMB Collection 3038–0079 
a. Commission Regulation 23.431 
As discussed above, the revisions to 
§ 23.431
300
make certain changes that 
the Commission believes will 
substantively reduce the burden of 
complying with the regulation, 
including the elimination of both the 
PTMMM Requirement and the Scenario 
Analysis Requirement (as detailed 
supra). 
The Commission estimates that 
eliminating the PTMMM Requirement 
will decrease Swap Entities’ burden 
hours incurred for each swap 
transaction by 10% on average. The 
Commission understands that, in certain 
rare cases (e.g., where a Swap Entity develops internal models to determine a 
PTMMM for swaps that are not widely 
traded), producing a PTMMM may take 
a Swap Entity a significant amount of 
time; however, in the majority of cases, 
much of the process for generating a 
PTMMM for a particular swap has been 
automated by Swap Entities and, thus, 
the burden of preparing a PTMMM is 
very low. Thus, the Commission 
believes that this estimated burden 
reduction is appropriate. 
Further, the Commission estimates 
that eliminating the Scenario Analysis 
Requirement will decrease Swap 
Entities’ burden hours incurred for each 
swap transaction by 5% on average 
across all Swap Entities. Although 
preparing a scenario analysis for a 
particular swap may take a substantial 
amount of time, the Commission 
understands that such analyses are 
rarely, if ever, requested as many 
counterparties have not found them to 
be useful in considering entering into a 
swap (or, in the alternative, Swap 
Entities are unwilling to do business 
with a counterparty that requires a 
scenario analysis due to the cost of 
providing such analysis). 
The Final Rule also: (i) expands the 
exceptions in § 23.431(c)
301
from the 
pre-trade disclosure requirements in 
§ 23.431(a)
302
for certain ITBC Swaps 
and Permitted PB Transactions,
303
and 
expands existing exceptions from such 
requirements to Exempt SEFs as shown 
in the revised regulatory text, infra; and (ii) provides an exception from the 
requirement in § 23.431(d)(1)
304
to 
provide notice of the right to receive a 
daily mark for each cleared swap from 
the appropriate clearing organization for 
certain ITBC Swaps. Meeting the 
requirements for certain of these 
exceptions may entail certain burdens 
and costs as discussed in Section III. B., 
infra, but the Commission believes that in the aggregate the modifications may 
reduce the burden of the regulations. 
However, in an effort to be conservative, 
because the number of swaps that will 
be eligible for the new and expanded 
exceptions is unknown, the Commission 
is leaving the estimated burden of the 
regulation associated with these 
amendments unchanged. 
The Commission believes that the 
other changes to § 23.431
305
in the Final 
Rule do not substantively affect the 
burden of the regulation. This includes: 
(i) clarifying the requirements for 
disclosure of the material characteristics 
of a swap in § 23.431(a)(2);
306
and (ii) 
providing SDs with additional 
flexibility in calculating the daily mark 
for a swap under final § 23.431(d)(3).
307
 
b. Commission Regulations 23.402, 430, 
432, 434, 440, 450, and 451 
The Final Rule is amending §§ 23.402, 
430, 432, 434, 440, 450, and 451
308
to 
create exceptions from the requirements 
of the regulations for certain ITBC 
Swaps and, where applicable, expand 
existing exceptions from such 
requirements to Exempt SEFs, as 
reflected infra in the regulatory text. Although the adoption of these changes 
may in the aggregate result in lesser 
burdens for market participants subject 
to these requirements, in an effort to be 
conservative, the Commission is leaving 
its estimated burdens of these 
requirements unchanged at this time, as 
the potential amount of the reduction of 
any such burden is unknown.
309
For 
example, although the new exceptions 
adopted in the Final Rule may apply for 
certain swaps entered into between a 
Swap Entity and its counterparty, the 
same parties may enter into other swaps 
that are not covered by the exceptions, 
such that, notwithstanding the 
exceptions in the Final Rule, certain of 
the requirements will continue to apply 
(e.g., the KYC procedures of § 23.402(b) and the representations under §§ 23.440 
and 450).
310
 
c. Estimated Revised Burdens Under 
OMB Control Number 3038–0079 
In consideration of the above and the 
current number of Swap Entities, the 
Commission estimates that the total 
overall burdens for OMB Control 
Number 3038–0079 will be 
approximately as follows: 
Estimated number of respondents 
affected: 108. Estimated total annual burden hours 
per respondent: 2,173. 
Estimated aggregate total burden 
hours for all respondents: 230,341. 
There are no capital costs or operating 
and maintenance costs associated with 
this collection. 
2. OMB Collection 3038–0088—Swap 
Documentation 
a. Commission Regulation 23.504 
Similar to the regulations discussed 
above, the Final Rule modifies 
§ 23.504
311
to create exceptions from 
the requirements of the regulation for 
ITBC Swaps and, where applicable, 
expand existing exceptions from such 
requirements to Exempt DCOs, as 
shown infra in the regulatory text. b. Estimated Burdens Under OMB 
Control Number 3038–0088 
Although the adoption of these 
changes may result in lesser burdens for 
market participants subject to § 23.504, 
in an effort to be conservative in 
estimating the amount of the change, the 
Commission determined to leave its 
estimated burdens of these requirements 
unchanged at this time as the potential

amount of the reduction of any such 
burden is unknown. For example, 
although the new exceptions may apply 
for certain swaps between a Swap Entity 
and its counterparty, the same parties 
may enter into other swaps that are not 
covered by the exceptions, such that, 
notwithstanding the exceptions in this 
Final Rule, compliance with § 23.504 
would nonetheless be required. 
Accordingly, the Commission is 
retaining its existing estimates for the 
burden associated with the information 
collections under OMB Collection 
3038–0088.
312
The Commission does 
not anticipate any capital costs or 
operating and maintenance costs would 
be incurred by market participants 
related to the proposed modifications to 
§ 23.504. 
3. Information Collection Comments 
In the Proposed Rule, the Commission 
requested comments on the information 
collection requirements discussed 
above, including, without limitation, on 
the Commission’s discussion of the 
estimated burden of the collection of 
information requirements in the 
Proposal. The Commission did not 
receive any such comments. 
D. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 
14192 
Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct agencies to assess all costs and 
benefits of available regulatory 
alternatives and, if regulation is 
necessary, to select those regulatory 
approaches that maximize net benefits 
(including potential economic, 
environmental, public health and safety, 
and other advantages; and distributive 
impacts). Section 3(f) of Executive Order 
12866 defines a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ as any regulatory action that is 
likely to result in a rule that may: (1) 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more or adversely 
affect in a material way the economy, a 
sector of the economy, productivity, 
competition, jobs, the environment, 
public health or safety, or State, local, 
or tribal governments or communities; 
(2) create a serious inconsistency or 
otherwise interfere with an action taken 
or planned by another agency; (3) 
materially alter the budgetary impact of 
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan 
programs or the rights and obligations of 
recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel 
legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
mandates, or the President’s priorities. 
The Office of Management and Budget 
has determined that this action is not a 
significant regulatory action as defined 
in Executive Order 12866, as amended, 
and therefore it was not subject to 
Executive Order 12866 review. 
This Final Rule is not an Executive 
Order 14192 regulatory action, because 
it is not a significant regulatory action 
under E.O. 12866. 
E. Congressional Review Act 
Pursuant to the Congressional Review 
Act,
313
the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs has designated this 
Final Rule as not a ‘‘major rule,’’ as 
defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

execution facility by the Commission

subpart, includes any person who is a

(‘‘Exempt DCO’’);

an agreement with a clearing member of 
such DCO for clearing of swaps of the 
same type as the swap intended to be 
cleared; 
(5) If the swap is intended to be 
cleared on an Exempt DCO, the swap 
entity and its counterparty must be 
eligible to clear the swap on the Exempt 
DCO pursuant to the terms and 
conditions of the Order of Exemption 
from Registration issued by the 
Commission regarding such Exempt 
DCO; 
(6) The swap entity does not require 
its counterparty or its clearing member

execution facility (‘‘SEF’’), or a trading 
facility currently exempted from 
registration as a swap execution facility 
by the Commission pursuant to section 
5h(g) of the Act (‘‘Exempt SEF’’), the 
swap entity takes reasonable measures 
to ensure that both parties submit the 
swap for clearing to a DCO or Exempt 
DCO as quickly after execution as would 
be technologically practicable if fully 
automated systems were used, and 
either: 
(i) The parties have agreed prior to or 
at execution that if such swap is rejected 
from clearing, the swap is deemed to be 
void ab initio, or (ii) The parties, prior to execution,

or similar arrangement that addresses 
the disposition of such rejected swap 
and includes arrangements that will 
permit a Swap Entity to comply with

this part with respect to the rejected 
swap; 
(8) If the swap is executed on or 
pursuant to the rules of a DCM, SEF, or 
Exempt SEF, the rules of the DCM, SEF, 
or Exempt SEF provide that if the swap 
is rejected from clearing, such swap is 
deemed to be void ab initio; provided 
that if the swap is executed on or 
pursuant to the rules of an Exempt SEF 
and the rules of the Exempt SEF do not 
provide for a swap rejected from 
clearing to be deemed void ab initio:

at execution that if such swap is rejected 
from clearing, the swap is deemed to be 
void ab initio, or (ii) The parties, prior to execution,

material economic terms and price with 
a counterparty (the ‘‘Trigger CP’’); and

may include a spread or fee to be paid

the services of the intermediary.

Prime Broker Arrangement that meets

Covered Transaction that may be 
entered into by the PB Counterparty 
with the Prime Broker pursuant to such 
Prime Broker Arrangement (each, a 
‘‘Permitted PB Transaction’’); and 
(2) The PB Counterparty has received 
from the Prime Broker all disclosures 
regarding the Permitted PB Transactions 
that, to the best of the Prime Broker’s 
knowledge and reasonable belief, would

representations may be contained in 
counterparty relationship

relevant requirements of this subpart for 
subsequent swaps offered to or entered 
into with a counterparty, provided 
however, that such counterparty 
undertakes to timely update any 
material changes to the representations. 
(e) Manner of disclosure. A swap entity may provide the information

deceptive, or manipulative. 
(b) Affirmative defense. It shall be an affirmative defense to an alleged 
violation of paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of

subject to restrictions on certain 
political contributions imposed by the

regulatory organization subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Commission or the

provided however, that this paragraph 
(b)(1)(vii) shall not apply if the 
representative is an employee of the 
Special Entity. 
(2) Any swap entity that offers to 
enter or enters into a swap with a 
Special Entity as defined in 
§ 23.401(h)(3) shall have a reasonable 
basis to believe that the Special Entity 
has a representative that is a fiduciary 
as defined in section 3 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(29 U.S.C. 1002). 
(c) Independent. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, a 
representative of a Special Entity will be 
deemed to be independent of the swap 
entity if:

the swap entity within the meaning of 
section 1a(4) of the Act;

between the representative of the 
Special Entity and the swap entity; 
(3) The representative:

recommend, or introduce the 
representative to the Special Entity 
within one year of the representative’s 
representation of the Special Entity in 
connection with the swap. 
(d) Safe harbor. (1) A swap entity shall be deemed to have a reasonable 
basis to believe that the Special Entity, 
other than a Special Entity defined in 
§ 23.401(h)(3), has a representative that 
satisfies the applicable requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, 
provided that: 
(i) The Special Entity represents in 
writing to the swap entity that it has 
complied in good faith with written 
policies and procedures reasonably 
designed to ensure that it has selected 
a representative that satisfies the 
applicable requirements of paragraph (b) 
of this section, and that such policies 
and procedures provide for ongoing 
monitoring of the performance of such 
representative consistent with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section; and

paragraph (c) of this section; and

the applicable requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section by

have a reasonable basis to believe that 
a Special Entity defined in 
§ 23.401(h)(3) has a representative that 
satisfies the applicable requirements in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
provided that the Special Entity 
provides in writing to the swap entity 
the representative’s name and contact 
information, and represents in writing 
that the representative is a fiduciary as 
defined in section 3 of the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 
(29 U.S.C. 1002). 
(e) Reasonable reliance on representations of the Special Entity. A 
swap entity may rely on written 
representations of a Special Entity and, 
as applicable under this section, the 
Special Entity’s representative to satisfy 
any requirement of this section as 
provided in § 23.402(d). 
(f) Chief compliance officer review. If a swap entity initially determines that it 
does not have a reasonable basis to 
believe that the representative of a 
Special Entity meets the criteria 
established in this Section, the swap 
entity shall make a written record of the 
basis for such determination and submit 
such determination to its chief 
compliance officer for review to ensure 
that the swap entity has a substantial, 
unbiased basis for the determination. 
(g) Disclosures. Before the initiation of a swap, a swap entity shall disclose to 
the Special Entity in writing: 
(1) The capacity in which it is acting 
in connection with the swap; and 
(2) If the swap entity engages in 
business with the Special Entity in more 
than one capacity, the swap entity shall 
disclose the material differences 
between such capacities.
