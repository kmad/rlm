AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. 
ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all 
ATR—GIE Avions de Transport 
Re´gional Model ATR42–200, –300, and 
–320 airplanes. This AD was prompted 
by a determination that new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations are 
necessary. This AD requires revising the 
existing maintenance or inspection 
program, as applicable, to incorporate 
new or more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations. The FAA is issuing this AD 
to address the unsafe condition on these 
products. 
DATES: This AD is effective February 9, 2026. 
The Director of the Federal Register 
approved the incorporation by reference 
of a certain publication listed in this AD 
as of February 9, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: 
AD Docket: You may examine the AD 
docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–2269; or in person at 
Docket Operations between 9 a.m. and 
5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except 
Federal holidays. The AD docket 
contains this final rule, the mandatory 
continuing airworthiness information 
(MCAI), any comments received, and 
other information. The address for 
Docket Operations is U.S. Department of

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The FAA issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR 
part 39 by adding an AD that would 
apply to all ATR—GIE Avions de 
Transport Re´gional Model ATR42–200, 
–300, and –320 airplanes. The NPRM 
was published in the Federal Register 
on August 26, 2025 (90 FR 41523). The 
NPRM was prompted by EASA AD 
2025–0044, dated February 19, 2025 
(EASA AD 2025–0044) (also referred to 
as the MCAI), issued by EASA, which 
is the Technical Agent for the Member 
States of the European Union. The 
MCAI states that new or more restrictive 
airworthiness limitations have been 
developed. 
In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to 
require revising the existing 
maintenance or inspection program, as 
applicable, to incorporate new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations, as 
specified in EASA AD 2025–0044. The 
FAA is issuing this AD to address the 
potential of ignition sources inside fuel 
tanks. The unsafe condition, if not 
addressed, could result in fuel tank 
ignition. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–2269. 
Discussion of Final Airworthiness 
Directive 
Comments 
The FAA received comments from the 
Air Line Pilots Association, 
International (ALPA) who supported the 
NPRM without change. 
Conclusion 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI 
referenced above. The FAA reviewed 
the relevant data, considered any 
comments received, and determined 
that air safety requires adopting this AD 
as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is 
issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is 
adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the 
economic burden on any operator. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025– 
0044, which specifies new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations 
related to fuel tank ignition prevention. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD 
affects 17 airplanes of U.S. registry. The 
FAA estimates the following costs to 
comply with this AD: 
The FAA has determined that revising 
the existing maintenance or inspection 
program takes an average of 90 work- 
hours per operator, although the agency 
recognizes that this number may vary 
from operator to operator. Since 
operators incorporate maintenance or 
inspection program changes for their 
affected fleet(s), the FAA has 
determined that a per-operator estimate 
is more accurate than a per-airplane 
estimate. Therefore, the agency 
estimates the average total cost per 
operator to be $7,650 (90 work-hours × 
$85 per work-hour).

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES196 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Rules and Regulations Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
This AD will not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that this AD: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Will not affect intrastate aviation 
in Alaska, and 
(3) Will not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act. 
List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 
Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation 
safety, Incorporation by reference, 
Safety. 
The Amendment 
Accordingly, under the authority 
delegated to me by the Administrator, 
the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as 
follows: 
PART 39—AIRWORTHINESS 
DIRECTIVES 
1. The authority citation for part 39 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701. § 39.13 [Amended] 
2. The FAA amends § 39.13 by adding 
the following new airworthiness 
directive: 
2025–26–01 ATR—GIE Avions de 
Transport Re´gional: Amendment 39– 23222; Docket No. FAA–2025–2269;

(2) Paragraph (3) of EASA AD 2025–0044 
specifies revising ‘‘the approved AMP,’’ 
within 12 months after its effective date, but 
this AD requires revising the existing 
maintenance or inspection program, as 
applicable, within 90 days after the effective 
date of this AD. 
(3) This AD does not adopt the provisions 
specified in paragraphs (4) of EASA AD

section of EASA AD 2025–0044. 
(i) Provisions for Alternative Critical Design 
Configuration Control Limitations (CDCCLs) 
After the existing maintenance or 
inspection program has been revised as 
required by paragraph (g) of this AD, no 
alternative CDCCLs are allowed unless they 
are approved as specified in the provisions 
of the ‘‘Ref. Publications’’ section of EASA 
AD 2025–0044. 
(j) Terminating Action for Certain Tasks 
Required by AD 2025–10–06 
Accomplishing the actions required by this 
AD terminates the corresponding 
requirements of paragraph (j) of AD 2025–10– 
06 for the tasks identified in the material 
referenced in EASA AD 2025–0044 only. 
(k) Additional AD Provisions 
The following provisions also apply to this

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The FAA issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR 
part 39 by adding an AD that would 
apply to all Airbus SAS Model A330– 
200, A330–200 Freighter, A330–300, 
A330–800, A330–900, A340–200, A340– 
300, A340–500, and A340–600 series 
airplanes. The NPRM was published in 
the Federal Register on July 28, 2025 (90 FR 35483). The NPRM was 
prompted by AD 2025–0053, dated 
March 5, 2025, issued by EASA, which 
is the Technical Agent for the Member 
States of the European Union (EASA AD 
2025–0053) (also referred to as the 
MCAI). The MCAI states that there were 
reported occurrences of forward 
passenger/crew doors jamming during 
slide deployment. Subsequent 
investigations determined that those 
events were caused by door mis-rigging. 
This condition, if not detected and 
corrected, could lead to unsuccessful 
slide deployment which, in case of an 
emergency, could prevent timely 
evacuation from the airplane. 
In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to 
require repetitive detailed inspections 
and, depending on findings, corrective 
action(s), as specified in EASA AD 
2025–0053. The FAA is issuing this AD 
to address the unsafe condition on these 
products. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–1721. 
Discussion of Final Airworthiness 
Directive 
Comments 
The FAA received a comment from 
Air Line Pilots Association, 
International, who supported the NPRM 
without change. 
Conclusion 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI 
referenced above. The FAA reviewed 
the relevant data, considered any 
comments received, and determined 
that air safety requires adopting this AD 
as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is 
issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is 
adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the 
economic burden on any operator. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025– 
0053, which specifies procedures for 
repetitive detailed inspections to check 
the clearances between the door and 
door frame on each door stop fitting, 
check the rigging values of the X-guide 
roller, check the clearance values 
between the rollers and the guide 
fittings, and ensure all door stop screw 
tab washers are properly bent on 
forward passenger/crew doors. On- 
condition actions include performing 
adjustment of the door(s), performing 
another detailed inspection of the 
clearance, obtaining and following 
further instructions if discrepancies 
remain, and reporting any measured 
value that is not within limits or any 
washer that is not bent properly. This 
material is reasonably available because 
the interested parties have access to it 
through their normal course of business 
or by the means identified in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD 
affects 159 airplanes of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following costs 
to comply with this AD:

Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
This AD will not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that this AD: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Will not affect intrastate aviation 
in Alaska, and 
(3) Will not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

–253N, –251NX, –252NX, –253NX, 
–271N, –272N, –271NX, and –272NX 
airplanes. This emergency AD was 
prompted by an uncommanded and 
limited pitch down event that occurred 
on an Airbus A320 airplane, where the 
autopilot remained engaged with a brief 
and limited loss of altitude. This 
emergency AD requires replacement or 
modification of each affected elevator 
aileron computer (ELAC). The 
emergency AD also prohibits the 
installation of affected parts on certain 
airplane configurations. The FAA

known U.S. owners and operators of 
these airplanes. The FAA is issuing this 
emergency AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. 
DATES: This AD is effective January 6, 2026. Emergency AD 2025–24–51, 
issued on November 28, 2025, which 
contains the requirements of this 
amendment, was effective with actual 
notice. 
The Director of the Federal Register 
approved the incorporation by reference 
of a certain publication listed in this AD 
as of January 6, 2026.

an unsafe condition on all Airbus SAS 
Model A319 and A320 series airplanes; 
and Model A321–211, –212, –213, –231, 
–232, –251N, –252N, –253N, –251NX, 
–252NX, –253NX, –271N, –272N, 
–271NX, and –272NX airplanes. The 
FAA sent the emergency AD to all 
known U.S. owners and operators of 
these airplanes. The Emergency AD 
2025–24–51 requires replacement or 
modification of each affected ELAC with 
a serviceable ELAC. The emergency AD 
also prohibits the installation of affected 
parts on certain airplane configurations. 
Emergency AD 2025–24–51 was 
prompted by EASA Emergency AD 
2025–0268–E, dated November 28, 2025 
(EASA Emergency AD 2025–0268–E) 
(also referred to as the MCAI), issued by 
EASA, which is the Technical Agent for 
the Member States of the European 
Union, to correct an unsafe condition on 
all Airbus SAS Model A319 series 
airplanes; A320–211, –212, –214, –215, 
–216, –231, –232, –233, –251N, –252N, 
–253N, –271N, –272N, and –273N 
airplanes; and Model A321–211, –212, 
–213, –231, –232, –251N, –252N, 
–253N, –251NX, –252NX, –253NX, 
–271N, –272N, –271NX, and –272NX 
airplanes. Model A320–215 airplanes 
are not certificated by the FAA and are 
not included on the U.S. type certificate 
data sheet; this emergency AD therefore 
does not include those airplanes in the 
applicability. The MCAI states an 
Airbus A320 airplane recently 
experienced an uncommanded and 
limited pitch down event. The autopilot 
remained engaged throughout the event, 
with a brief and limited loss of altitude, 
and the rest of the flight was uneventful. 
Preliminary technical assessment done 
by Airbus identified a malfunction of 
the affected ELAC as a possible 
contributing factor. 
The FAA is issuing this emergency 
AD to address a malfunction of the 
affected ELAC. The unsafe condition 
could lead to an uncommanded elevator 
movement that may result in exceeding 
the aircraft’s structural capability and 
consequent loss of continued safe flight 
and landing. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5395. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA Emergency 
AD 2025–0268–E. This material 
specifies procedures for replacing or 
modifying each affected ELAC with a 
serviceable ELAC. EASA Emergency AD 
2025–0268–E also prohibits the 
installation of affected parts on certain 
airplane configurations. 
The FAA also reviewed Airbus Alert 
Operators Transmission (AOT) 
A27N022–25, Revision 01, dated 
November 28, 2025. This material lists 
airplane configurations that are part of 
the Group 1 definition in EASA 
Emergency AD 2025–0268–E. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI 
described above. The FAA is issuing 
this emergency AD after determining 
that the unsafe condition described 
previously is likely to exist or develop 
on other products of the same type 
design. 
AD Requirements 
This emergency AD requires 
accomplishing the actions specified in 
the MCAI described previously. 
Explanation of Required Compliance 
Information 
In the FAA’s ongoing efforts to 
improve the efficiency of the AD 
process, the FAA developed a process to 
use some civil aviation authority (CAA) 
ADs as the primary source of 
information for compliance with 
requirements for corresponding FAA 
ADs. The FAA has been coordinating 
this process with manufacturers and 
CAAs. As a result, EASA Emergency AD 
2025–0268–E is incorporated by 
reference in this emergency AD. This 
AD requires compliance with EASA 
Emergency AD 2025–0268–E in its 
entirety through that incorporation, 
except for any differences identified as 
exceptions in the regulatory text of this 
emergency AD. Using common terms 
that are the same as the heading of a 
particular section in EASA Emergency 
AD 2025–0268–E does not mean that 
operators need comply only with that 
section. For example, where the 
emergency AD requirement refers to ‘‘all 
required actions and compliance times,’’ 
compliance with this emergency AD 
requirement is not limited to the section 
titled ‘‘Required Action(s) and 
Compliance Time(s)’’ in EASA 
Emergency AD 2025–0268–E. Material 
required by EASA Emergency AD 2025– 
0268–E for compliance will be available 
at regulations.gov under Docket No. VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:03 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 4700 Sfmt 4700 E:\FR\FM\05JAR1.SGM 05JAR1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES201 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Rules and Regulations FAA–2025–5395 after this emergency 
AD is published. 
Justification for Immediate Adoption 
and Determination of the Effective Date 
Section 553(b) of the Administrative 
Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 et 
seq.) authorizes agencies to forgo notice 
and comment procedures for rules when 
the agency, for ‘‘good cause,’’ finds that 
those procedures are ‘‘impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest.’’ Under this section, an agency, 
upon finding good cause, may issue a 
final rule without providing notice and 
seeking comment prior to issuance. 
Further, section 553(d) of the APA 
authorizes agencies to make rules 
effective in less than thirty days, upon 
a finding of good cause. 
An unsafe condition exists that 
required the immediate adoption of 
Emergency AD 2025–24–51, issued on 
November 28, 2025, to all known U.S. 
owners and operators of these airplanes. 
The FAA found that the risk to the 
flying public justified forgoing notice 
and comment prior to adoption of this 
rule because malfunction of the affected 
ELAC could lead to an uncommanded 
elevator movement that may result in 
exceeding the aircraft’s structural 
capability and consequent loss of 
continued safe flight and landing. These 
conditions still exist, and the AD is 
hereby published in the Federal 
Register as an amendment to 14 CFR 39.13 to make it effective to all persons. 
Given the significance of the risk 
presented by this unsafe condition, it 
must be immediately addressed. 
Accordingly, notice and opportunity for 
prior public comment are impracticable 
and contrary to the public interest 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b). 
In addition, the FAA finds that good 
cause exists pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) 
for making this amendment effective in 
less than 30 days, for the same reasons 
the FAA found good cause to forgo 
notice and comment. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
The requirements of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act (RFA) do not apply when 
an agency finds good cause pursuant to 
5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without 
prior notice and comment. Because the 
FAA has determined that it has good 
cause to adopt this rule without notice 
and comment, RFA analysis is not 
required. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this 
emergency AD affects 2,007 airplanes of 
U.S. registry. Of those, approximately 
550 airplanes are Group 1 airplanes that 
may require modification or 
replacement. The FAA estimates the 
following costs to comply with this 
emergency AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS OFREQUIREDACTIONS 
Action Labor cost Parts cost Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
Replacement or modification (Group 1 air-
planes).
3 work-hours × $85 per hour = $255 ............. Unknown * ...... $255  $140,250 * The FAA has received no definitive data on which to base the part cost estimate for the required actions specified in this emergency AD. 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
This AD will not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This AD will not have a 
substantial direct effect on the States, on 
the relationship between the national 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify that this AD: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
and 
(2) Will not affect intrastate aviation 
in Alaska.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with RULES202 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Rules and Regulations (e) Unsafe Condition 
This emergency AD was prompted by an 
uncommanded and limited pitch down event 
that occurred on an Airbus A320 airplane, 
where the autopilot remained engaged with 
a brief and limited loss of altitude. The FAA 
is issuing this emergency AD to address a 
malfunction of the affected elevator aileron 
computer (ELAC). The unsafe condition 
could lead to an uncommanded elevator 
movement that may result in exceeding the 
aircraft’s structural capability and 
consequent loss of continued safe flight and 
landing. 
(f) Compliance 
Comply with this emergency AD within 
the compliance times specified, unless 
already done. 
(g) Requirements 
Except as specified in paragraph (h) of this 
emergency AD: Comply with all required 
actions and compliance times specified in, 
and in accordance with, European Union 
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Emergency 
AD 2025–0268–E, dated November 28, 2025 
(EASA Emergency AD 2025–0268–E). 
(h) Exceptions to EASA Emergency AD 2025– 
0268–E 
(1) Where EASA Emergency AD 2025– 
0268–E refers to its effective date, this 
emergency AD requires using the effective 
date of this emergency AD. 
(2) Where EASA Emergency AD 2025– 
0268–E specifies a compliance time of before 
next flight after the effective date of this AD, 
this emergency AD requires a compliance 
time of before further flight after the effective 
date of this emergency AD. 
(3) Where EASA Emergency AD 2025– 
0268–E defines Group 1 airplanes as those 
having an affected ELAC installed and being 
in one of the configurations defined in the 
AOT, this emergency AD defines Group 1 
airplanes as those having an affected ELAC 
installed and being in one of the 
configurations defined in paragraph 1 of 
Airbus Alert Operators Transmission (AOT) 
A27N022–25, Revision 01, dated November 
28, 2025. 
(4) Where EASA Emergency AD 2025– 
0268–E specifies a ferry flight is permitted, 
this emergency AD allows special flight 
permits to be issued in accordance with 14 
CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the 
airplane without passengers and in non- 
ETOPS operations to a location where the 
airplane can be modified (if the operator 
elects to do so), for no more than 3 flight 
cycles. 
(i) Additional AD Provisions 
The following provisions also apply to this 
emergency AD:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
The FAA issued a notice of proposed 
rulemaking (NPRM) to amend 14 CFR 
part 39 by adding an AD that would 
apply to certain ATR—GIE Avions de 
Transport Re´gional Model ATR42–500 
airplanes. The NPRM was published in 
the Federal Register on August 29, 2025 (90 FR 42140). The NPRM was 
prompted by AD 2025–0005, dated 
January 7, 2025 (EASA AD 2025–0005) 
(also referred to as the MCAI), issued by 
EASA, which is the Technical Agent for 
the Member States of the European 
Union. The MCAI states that new or 
more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations have been developed. 
In the NPRM, the FAA proposed to 
require revising the existing 
maintenance or inspection program, as 
applicable, to incorporate new or more 
restrictive airworthiness limitations, as 
specified in EASA AD 2025–0005. The 
FAA is issuing this AD to address 
reduced structural integrity of the 
airplane or reduced controllability of 
the airplane. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–2270. 
Discussion of Final Airworthiness 
Directive 
Comments 
The FAA received a comment from 
Air Line Pilots Association, 
International who supported the NPRM 
without change. 
The FAA received an additional 
comment from an anonymous 
commenter that was outside the scope 
of this AD. 
Conclusion 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this 
State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI 
referenced above. The FAA reviewed 
the relevant data, considered any 
comments received, and determined 
that air safety requires adopting this AD 
as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is 
issuing this AD to address the unsafe 
condition on these products. Except for 
minor editorial changes, this AD is 
adopted as proposed in the NPRM. 
None of the changes will increase the 
economic burden on any operator. 
Material Incorporated by Reference 
Under 1 CFR Part 51 
The FAA reviewed EASA AD 2025– 
0005, which specifies procedures for 
new or more restrictive airworthiness 
limitations for airplane structures and 
safe life limits. 
This material is reasonably available 
because the interested parties have 
access to it through their normal course 
of business or by the means identified 
in the 
ADDRESSESsection. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD 
affects 11 airplanes of U.S. registry. The 
FAA estimates the following costs to 
comply with this AD: 
The FAA has determined that revising 
the existing maintenance or inspection 
program takes an average of 90 work- 
hours per operator, although the agency 
recognizes that this number may vary 
from operator to operator. Since 
operators incorporate maintenance or 
inspection program changes for their 
affected fleet(s), the FAA has 
determined that a per-operator estimate 
is more accurate than a per-airplane 
estimate. Therefore, the agency 
estimates the average total cost per 
operator to be $7,650 (90 work-hours × 
$85 per work-hour). 
Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
This AD will not have federalism

11.35, the FAA will post all comments 
received, without change, to 
regulations.gov, including any personal information you provide. The agency 
will also post a report summarizing each 
substantive verbal contact received 
about this NPRM. 
Confidential Business Information 
CBI is commercial or financial 
information that is both customarily and 
actually treated as private by its owner. 
Under the Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), CBI is exempt 
from public disclosure. If your 
comments responsive to this NPRM 
contain commercial or financial 
information that is customarily treated 
as private, that you actually treat as 
private, and that is relevant or 
responsive to this NPRM, it is important 
that you clearly designate the submitted 
comments as CBI. Please mark each 
page of your submission containing CBI 
as ‘‘PROPIN.’’ The FAA will treat such 
marked submissions as confidential 
under the FOIA, and they will not be 
placed in the public docket of this 
NPRM. Submissions containing CBI 
should be sent to Doug Rudolph, 
Aviation Safety Engineer, FAA, 1600 
Stewart Avenue, Suite 410, Westbury, 
NY 11590. Any commentary that the 
FAA receives which is not specifically 
designated as CBI will be placed in the 
public docket for this rulemaking. 
Background 
The European Union Aviation Safety 
Agency (EASA), which is the Technical 
Agent for the Member States of the 
European Union, has issued EASA AD 
2025–0172, dated August 4, 2025 (EASA 
AD 2025–0172) (also referred to as the 
MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition 
on all General Atomics Model Dornier 
228–100, Dornier 228–101, Dornier 228– 
200, Dornier 228–201, Dornier 228–202, 
and Dornier 228–212 airplanes. The 
MCAI states that several occurrences 
were reported where the hydraulic 
pump motor became severely damaged 
by excessive heat. The MCAI further 
states that it was determined that carbon 
brushes installed on the affected 
hydraulic pump motor were the root 
cause of the failures. This condition, if 
not corrected, could lead to an 
uncontained fire, possible injury to 
passengers and crew, and consequent 
loss of control of the airplane. 
To address the unsafe condition, the 
brush manufacturer designed improved 
carbon brushes and General Atomics 
designed an improved hydraulic pump 
motor with these improved carbon 
brushes installed. The MCAI requires 
replacing the affected hydraulic pump 
motor with the improved hydraulic 
pump motor. The MCAI also prohibits 
installing the affected hydraulic pump 
motor on any airplane. 
You may examine the MCAI in the 
AD docket at regulations.gov under Docket No. FAA–2025–5401. 
FAA’s Determination 
These products have been approved 
by the civil aviation authority of another 
country and are approved for operation 
in the United States. Pursuant to the 
FAA’s bilateral agreement with this

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS206 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules State of Design Authority, that authority 
has notified the FAA of the unsafe 
condition described in the MCAI and 
material referenced above. The FAA is 
issuing this NPRM after determining 
that the unsafe condition described 
previously is likely to exist or develop 
on other products of the same type 
design. 
Proposed AD Requirements in This 
NPRM 
This proposed AD would require 
replacing the affected hydraulic pump 
motor with an improved design 
hydraulic pump motor. This proposed 
AD would also prohibit installing an 
affected hydraulic pump motor on any 
airplane. 
Costs of Compliance 
The FAA estimates that this AD, if 
adopted as proposed, would affect 16 
airplanes of U.S. registry. 
The FAA estimates the following 
costs to comply with this proposed AD: 
ESTIMATEDCOSTS 
Action Labor cost Parts cost Cost per 
product 
Cost on U.S. 
operators 
Replace hydraulic pump motor ........................... 3 work-hours × $85 per hour = $255 ................. $8,900  $9,155  $146,480 Authority for This Rulemaking 
Title 49 of the United States Code 
specifies the FAA’s authority to issue 
rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, 
section 106, describes the authority of 
the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: 
Aviation Programs, describes in more 
detail the scope of the Agency’s 
authority. 
The FAA is issuing this rulemaking 
under the authority described in 
Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 
44701: General requirements. Under 
that section, Congress charges the FAA 
with promoting safe flight of civil 
aircraft in air commerce by prescribing 
regulations for practices, methods, and 
procedures the Administrator finds 
necessary for safety in air commerce. 
This regulation is within the scope of 
that authority because it addresses an 
unsafe condition that is likely to exist or 
develop on products identified in this 
rulemaking action. 
Regulatory Findings 
The FAA determined that this 
proposed AD would not have federalism 
implications under Executive Order 
13132. This proposed AD would not 
have a substantial direct effect on the 
States, on the relationship between the 
national government and the States, or 
on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. 
For the reasons discussed above, I 
certify this proposed regulation: 
(1) Is not a ‘‘significant regulatory 
action’’ under Executive Order 12866, 
(2) Would not affect intrastate 
aviation in Alaska, and 
(3) Would not have a significant 
economic impact, positive or negative, 
on a substantial number of small entities 
under the criteria of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act.

This proposed regulation is being 
issued under the authority granted to 
the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services by the Child Care and 
Development Block Grant Act of 1990, 
as amended (42 U.S.C. 9857 et seq.), 
hereafter referred to as the ‘‘Act,’’ and 
section 418 of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 618). 
II. Background 
The Act (42 U.S.C. 9857 et seq.), 
together with section 418 of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618), authorize 
the Child Care and Development Fund 
(CCDF), which is the primary federal 
funding source dedicated to supporting 
working families with low incomes to 
afford child care and to increasing the 
quality of child care for all children. 
CCDF funds child care services in the 50 
states, the District of Columbia, 5 
territories, and 264 Tribal organizations. 
Federal Fiscal year (FFY) 2025 enacted 
CCDF funding is $12.30 billion awarded 
by formula to States, Territories, and 
Tribes. CCDF child care subsidies, 
primarily administered through 
vouchers, help working families with 
low incomes access child care that best 
meets their needs. In FFY 2022, the 
most recent year for which data is 
available, CCDF provided subsidies to 
over 1.4 million children from 870,000 
families each month.
1
CCDF also 
promotes the quality of child care by 
requiring CCDF Lead Agencies to spend 
at least 12 percent of their CCDF 
funding each year on activities to 
improve child care quality for all 
children in care. In FFY 2021, states 
spent $3 billion on activities to improve

the quality of child care and an 
additional $570 million on improving 
the quality and supply of infant and 
toddler care. 
Congress last reauthorized the CCDBG 
Act in 2014 (Pub. L. 113–186), and HHS 
published regulations implementing the 
new provisions of the Act in September 
2016 (81 FR 67438). The 2016 
regulations built on the priorities 
Congress included in the 
reauthorization. In July 2023, HHS 
proposed changes to a limited number 
of provisions in the CCDF regulations 
(88 FR 45043). In response to proposed 
changes, HHS received over 1,600 
public comments with many 
commenters, including CCDF Lead 
Agencies, noting concerns about the 
timing and costs associated with the 
proposed changes (89 FR 15372–3). The 
changes were codified in a final rule 
published by HHS in March 2024 (89 FR 
15366). 
Since publication of the March 2024 
final rule, several States and Territories 
have reiterated to HHS that some of the 
requirements added in the March 2024 
final rule are more costly and difficult 
to implement than HHS had estimated. 
This feedback has been shared through 
State and Territory CCDF plan 
appendices, in-person meetings and 
focus groups with CCDF administrators, 
and technical assistance inquiries. The 
numerous barriers to implementing 
these requirements are also evidenced 
by the fact that all States and Territories 
have two-year transitional and 
legislative waivers because they all 
needed additional time to implement at 
least one of the new requirements. More 
recently, some States have requested to 
renew these transitional and legislative 
waivers for two additional years to 
implement the changes because of the 
high cost and extensive systems changes 
necessary to come into compliance. 
This NPRM proposes to rescind the 
four most onerous requirements. The 
changes proposed in this NPRM align 
with the text of the Act, including the 
first purpose enumerated by Congress: 
‘‘to allow each State maximum 
flexibility in developing child care 
programs and policies that best suit the 
needs of children and parents within 
that State.’’ 42 U.S.C. 9857(b)(1). If the 
proposed changes are finalized, States, 
Territories, and Tribes will continue to 
have the option to adopt policies based 
on their own assessment of what works 
best for children, families, and child 
care providers in their communities. 
By proposing to remove these overly 
prescriptive requirements, this NPRM 
responds to Executive Order 14192, 
Unleashing Prosperity through 
Deregulation and would restore State, Territory, and Tribal flexibility for 
designing and operating their CCDF 
programs as they deem most 
appropriate. Under this Executive 
Order, ‘‘It is the policy of the executive 
branch to be prudent and financially 
responsible in the expenditure of funds, 
from both public and private sources, 
and to alleviate unnecessary regulatory 
burdens placed on the American 
people.’’ 
This NPRM also responds to Secretary 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s directive to 
‘‘launch the most sweeping deregulatory 
initiative in the history of the 
Department’’ of Health and Human 
Services by ‘‘eliminating bureaucratic 
red tape and ‘‘aggressively deregulating 
to return the freedoms eroded over 
decades by unnecessary and 
burdensome regulations.’’

90 FR 
20393–94. 
III. Executive Summary 
This NPRM proposes to rescind four 
requirements added in the March 2024 
final rule that are costly, burdensome, 
and overly prescriptive, especially 
compared to other block grant programs. 
All four rescissions would impact States 
and Territories. Only the repeal of the 
family co-payment limit would impact 
Tribal Lead Agencies, as Tribal Lead 
Agencies are already exempt from the 
requirements related to payment 
practices. As is standard with block 
grant programs, Lead Agencies would 
continue to have the flexibility to 
implement the policies required by the 
March 2024 final rule, but HHS would 
no longer require implementation of the 
rescinded requirements. 
€Repeal the federally mandated cap on family co-payments at § 98.45(l)(3). 
This proposed change removes the 
mandatory 7-percent cap that was 
imposed in the March 2024 final rule. 
With this change, CCDF policy would 
revert to the previous requirement that 
matches the statutory language that co- 
payments cannot be a barrier to families 
receiving child care assistance. In the 
preamble to the 2016 final rule, ACF 
established an optional Federal 
benchmark for family co-payments of no 
more than 7 percent of family income 
based on 2011 data from a U.S. Census 
Bureau report that showed families, on 
average, spent 7 percent of income on 
child care. 81 FR 67467–68. Despite no 
new evidence that showed higher co- 
payments were a barrier to accessing the 
child care subsidy, the March 2024 final 
rule changed the benchmark into a 
federal requirement. This limit on Lead 
Agencies’ ability to set co-payment 
amounts based on the needs of children, 
families, and providers in their State is 
counter to the first statutory purpose of 
CCDF, which is ‘‘to allow each State 
maximum flexibility in developing 
child care programs and policies that 
best suit the needs of children and 
parents within the State.’’ 42 U.S.C. 
9857(b)(1). This proposed change would 
restore Lead Agency flexibility to decide 
how best to balance the trade-offs 
between reducing child care costs for 
families participating in CCDF and 
serving additional families with higher 
co-payments. 
€Repeal the requirement to use some grants or contracts for direct services at 
§ 98.30(b)(1). The March 2024 final rule mandated States and Territories to use 
some grants or contracts to provide 
direct services for infants and toddlers, 
children with disabilities, and children 
in underserved geographic areas. HHS 
believes that this requirement is 
excessively prescriptive by mandating 
grants or contracts for particular 
populations and is difficult to 
implement. The stringent requirements 
mean that even some states that have a 
long history of using grants or contracts 
for direct services must make significant 
changes to meet the requirements of the 
March 2024 Final Rule. The proposed 
change to repeal this requirement will 
ensure that parents can use federal 
funding through certificates or vouchers 
to access the providers of their 
choosing, including faith-based 
providers. 
€Repeal the requirement to pay child care providers prospectively at 
§ 98.45(m)(1). The March 2024 final rule required provider payment in advance 
of or at the beginning of the delivery of 
service (i.e., prospectively) with limited exceptions. This NPRM proposes to 
rescind this requirement, which only six 
States have implemented to date, and 
would revert to the option for States and 
Territories to pay providers 
prospectively or on a reimbursement 
basis, which was the standard set forth 
in the 2016 final rule. As required by 
the Act at Section 658E(c)(4)(B)(iv) (42 
U.S.C. 9858c(c)(4)(B)(iv)), States and 
Territories must still ensure that child 
care providers are paid in a timely 
manner, which is critical for providers 
to participate in CCDF and increases the 
options available to parents. 
€Repeal the requirement to pay child care providers based on a child’s 
enrollment rather than attendance at 
§ 98.45(m)(2). The March 2024 final rule required States and Territories, with 
limited exceptions, to pay providers 
based on a child’s authorized 
enrollment. This policy, once fully

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS209 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules implemented, was estimated to cost 
$16.5 million per year. With its 
proposed repeal, States and Territories 
would have greater flexibility and 
multiple allowable options to meet the 
statutory requirement to delink provider 
payments from a child’s occasional 
absences. HHS believes that delinking 
payments is important to support 
providers’ fixed costs of delivering child 
care services and to encourage 
providers’ participation in CCDF. 
Effective Date 
ACF expects all provisions included 
in the proposed rule, if finalized, to 
become effective 60 days from the date 
of publication of the final rule. 
Costs, Benefits, and Transfer Impacts 
By rescinding several of the 
mandatory provisions added by the 
March 2024 final rule, this NPRM 
would prevent the occurrence of the 
estimated transfers and costs reported in 
the 2024 Regulatory Impact Analysis 
(RIA), with the exception of the 
anticipated economic impacts in the 
first year. 89 FR 15400–11. 
Over a 5-year time horizon covering 
2025 through 2029, ACF estimates 
annualized transfers of $23.4 million 
using a 3-percent discount rate and 
$22.8 using a 7-percent discount rate; 
and annualized costs of $6.7 million 
using a 3-percent discount rate and $6.6 
million using a 7-percent discount rate. 
Negative costs represent cost savings 
and negative transfers represent a 
reversal of the direction of transfers 
compared to the 2024 RIA. In this 
context, transfers under the March 2024 
final rule that represented increases in 
Lead Agency payments to child care 
providers represent reductions in Lead 
Agency payments to child care 
providers. 
To produce an estimate of cost 
savings under Executive Order 14192, 
we assume the impacts of the proposed 
changes on costs in 2029 will extend in 
perpetuity. We estimate that this NPRM 
will generate $6.1 million in annualized 
cost savings at a 7-percent discount rate, 
discounted relative to year 2024, in 
perpetuity. 
Severability 
The provisions of this NPRM, once it 
becomes final, are intended to be 
severable, such that, in the event a court 
were to invalidate any particular 
provision or deem it to be 
unenforceable, the remaining provisions 
would continue to be valid. The changes 
address a variety of issues relevant to 
child care. None of the provisions 
contained herein are central to an 
overall intent of the proposed rule, nor 
are any provisions dependent on the 
validity of other, separate provisions. 
IV. Discussion of Proposed Changes 
This NPRM would not alter the 
overall structure and organization of the 
current CCDF regulations. The preamble 
in this NPRM discusses the proposed 
changes to current regulations. Where 
language of previous regulations 
remains unchanged, the preamble 
explanation and interpretation of that 
language published with all prior final 
rules would also be retained, unless 
specifically proposed to be modified in 
the preamble to this NPRM. (See 57 FR 
34352, Aug. 4, 1992; 63 FR 39936, Jul. 
24, 1998; 72 FR 27972, May 18, 2007; 
72 FR 50889, Sep. 5, 2007; 81 FR 67438, 
Sept. 30, 2016; 89 FR 15366, March 1, 
2024; 89 FR 90605, November 18, 2024). 
Subpart B—General Application 
Procedures 
§ 98.16 Plan Provisions 
Supply of child care. This NPRM 
proposes to amend § 98.16(x) and 
remove paragraphs (y) and (z) to align 
with the previous regulatory language 
added in the 2016 final rule and 
conform with the proposed changes at 
§§ 98.30 and 98.50 to remove the 
requirement to use some grants or 
contracts for direct services. The 
proposed change at § 98.16(x) would 
restore language from the 2016 final rule 
that the Plan must: Identify shortages in 
the supply of high-quality child care 
providers; list the data sources used to 
identify supply shortages; and describe 
the method of tracking progress to 
support equal access and parental 
choice. Identification of supply gaps of 
high-quality care is a critical step of 
building supply and quality for certain 
populations, as required by the Act. 
The proposed language at § 98.16(x) is 
based on statutory language at Section 
658E(c)(2)(M) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
9858c(c)(2)(M)), which requires the 
Lead Agency to describe strategies to 
increase the supply and improve the 
quality of child care services for 
children in underserved areas, infants 
and toddlers, children with disabilities, 
and children who receive care during 
nontraditional hours. As described in 
the Act, the strategies may include 
alternative payment rates to child care 
providers, the provision of direct 
contracts or grants to community-based 
organizations, offering child care 
certificates to parents, or other means 
determined by the Lead Agency. In 
addition to alternative payment rates 
and contracts, Lead Agencies may 
consider other strategies, including 
training and technical assistance to 
child care providers to increase quality 
for these types of care. 
With these proposed changes, 
§ 98.16(aa) through (ll) would be 
redesignated as § 98.16(y) through (jj). 
Payment practices. The NPRM 
proposes minor changes to language at 
§ 98.16(ee) (redesignated as § 98.16(cc)) 
to match the language of the 2016 final 
rule and conform with changes made at 
§ 98.45(m). The revised provision 
requires Lead Agencies to describe in 
their CCDF Plans payment practices 
applicable to child care providers 
receiving CCDF, pursuant to § 98.45(m), 
including practices to ensure timely 
payment for services, to delink provider 
payments from children’s occasional 
absences to the extent practicable, and 
to reflect generally accepted payment 
practices. 
Subpart D—Program Operations (Child 
Care Services) Parental Rights and 
Responsibilities 
§ 98.30 Parental Choice 
This NPRM proposes to rescind the 
requirement at § 98.30(b)(1) for States 
and Territories to provide some portion 
of the delivery of direct services via 
grants or contracts, including at a 
minimum for children in underserved 
geographic areas, infants and toddlers, 
and children with disabilities. The 
current requirement to use some grants 
or contracts for direct child care services 
was added in the March 2024 final rule. 
89 FR 15381–83. These requirements are 
administratively burdensome and too 
restrictive to allow States to manage the 
CCDF program in a manner that 
appropriately addresses their supply 
needs. Based on the FFY 2025–2027 
CCDF State and Territory Plans, the vast 
majority of States and Territories have 
not implemented grants or contracts for 
child care services that met the specific 
requirements previously included in the 
CCDF regulations. As of October 1, 
2024, only six States and one territory 
had implemented grants or contracts for 
children with disabilities, 10 States and 
one Territory had implemented grants 
or contracts for infants and toddlers, 
and nine States had implemented grants 
or contracts for children in underserved 
geographic regions. 
The Act requires that a State CCDF 
Plan provide assurances that parents 
participating in CCDF be offered ‘‘the 
option either- to enroll such child with 
a child care provider that has a grant or 
contract for the provision of such 
services; or to receive a child care 
certificate.’’ 42 U.S.C. 9858c(c)(2)(A). 
Therefore, this proposed rescission 
would not impact a Lead Agency’s 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:07 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\05JAP1.SGM 05JAP1

The benchmark is based on data from the U.S. 
Census Bureau that showed on average families 
spent 7 percent of income on child care, and that 
poor families on average spent approximately four 
times the share of their income on child care 
compared to higher income families. Who’s

ability to choose to use grants or 
contracts for direct services. 
Subpart E—Program Operations (Child 
Care Services) Lead Agency and 
Provider Requirements 
§ 98.45 Equal Access 
Demonstrating Affordable Co- 
Payments. The NPRM proposes a conforming change at § 98.45(b)(5) to 
remove the requirement for Lead 
Agencies to describe in their CCDF 
Plans how co-payments ‘‘do not exceed 
7 percent of income for all families.’’ 
Lead Agencies would still be required to 
demonstrate in their CCDF Plan how 
their co-payments are based on a sliding 
fee scale and are not a barrier to families 
receiving CCDF assistance. This 
proposed change aligns with the 
proposed elimination of the requirement 
at § 98.45(l)(3) to limit family co- 
payments to 7 percent of family income. 
Family Co-payments. The NPRM at 
§ 98.45(l)(3) proposes to rescind the 
requirement for States, Territories, and 
Tribes to establish co-payment policies 
for families that are ‘‘not to exceed 7 
percent of income for all families, 
regardless of the number of children in 
care who may be receiving CCDF 
assistance.’’ Section 658E(c)(5) of the 
Act requires Lead Agencies to establish 
and periodically revise a sliding fee 
scale that provides for cost sharing (i.e., 
co-payment) that is ‘‘not a barrier to 
families receiving’’ CCDF assistance. 42 
U.S.C. 9858c(c)(5). The Act does not 
specify what constitutes ‘‘a barrier.’’ The 
preamble of the 2016 final rule noted 
that ‘‘Lead Agencies have flexibility in 
establishing their sliding fee scales and 
determining what constitutes a cost 
barrier for families’’ and established 7 
percent as the federal benchmark
3
for 
an affordable co-payment for families 
receiving CCDF. 81 FR 67515. Despite 
no additional data indicating that co- 
payments above 7-percent were a 
barrier, the March 2024 final rule 
transformed that 7 percent federal 
benchmark into a requirement for all 
States, Territories, and Tribes. 89 FR 
15387–90. This lack of evidence 
therefore does not support turning a 
non-enforceable federal benchmark into 
a requirement. 
This NPRM proposes to revert to the 
statutory language that matches the 
2016 final rule requirement. Based on 
FFY 2025–2027 CCDF State and 
Territory Plan data, 22 States and one 
Territory do not limit all co-payments to 
7 percent or less of family income. By 
rescinding the requirement to cap co- 
payments to 7 percent of a family’s 
income, this NPRM supports State and 
Territory flexibility to determine what is 
affordable and what constitutes a barrier 
for the CCDF families they serve. 
Reverting to the statutory and 2016 final 
rule language would not impact Lead 
Agencies’ ability to limit co-payments to 
7 percent of a family’s income or adopt 
a lower threshold that supports 
affordability. 
The NPRM proposes to remove 
§ 98.45(n)(5) which currently requires 
States and Territories to demonstrate in 
their CCDF Plan how they are ensuring 
they are not reducing the total payment 
(subsidy payment amount and co- 
payment) given to child care providers 
when implementing the requirement to 
limit co-payments to 7 percent of family 
income and the option of waiving co- 
payments for some families. A more 
detailed discussion of this proposed 
deletion is later in this preamble at the 
section titled Restructuring to Align 
with Previous Regulations, detailing 
changes to § 98.45(n). 
Payment Practices. This NPRM 
proposes to rescind the requirements at 
§ 98.45(m) for States and Territories to 
pay providers prospectively and by 
authorized enrollment. These 
requirements were added in the March 
2024 final rule. 89 FR 15391–93. Lead 
Agency payment practices are an 
important aspect of ensuring families 
participating in CCDF have equal access 
to care as private pay families. Payment 
practices also support the ability of 
providers to participate in CCDF so that 
parents have choice in affordable child 
care options for their children. The 
proposed rescissions would give States 
and Territories more options for 
establishing provider payment practices 
that better balances the need for 
providers to receive stable payments to 
support parental choice while limiting 
burden on States and Territories. 
Timely Payments to Providers. The 
NPRM proposes to amend language at 
§ 98.45(m)(1) to eliminate the 
requirement for States and Territories to 
pay providers in advance of or at the 
beginning of delivery of child care 
services, commonly referred to as 
prospective payments. Section 
658E(c)(4)(B)(iv) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 
9858c(c)(4)(B)(iv)) requires Lead 
Agencies to describe how they will 
provide for the timely payment for child 
care services provided by CCDF funds. 
To better ensure timely payments and 
meet statutory requirements, this NPRM 
proposes returning to the requirement of 
the 2016 final rule which gives Lead 
Agencies the option to either pay prospectively prior to the delivery of 
services or pay providers retrospectively within no more than 21 calendar days 
of the receipt of a complete invoice for 
services. This proposed change supports 
Lead Agency flexibility to determine the 
timely payment policies and procedures 
most appropriate for the State or 
Territory’s context. Based on FFY 2025– 
2027 CCDF State and Territory Plan 
data, 45 states and four Territories do 
not pay all provider types prospectively. 
The proposed changes would not 
impact a Lead Agency’s ability to 
choose to pay providers prospectively, 
and Lead Agencies that currently pay 
providers in advance of delivering child 
care services may continue to do so. 
The proposed change to allow Lead 
Agencies to pay child care providers on 
a reimbursement basis supports Lead 
Agency flexibility and addresses 
concerns about the systems changes 
needed to implement prospective 
payments, which HHS estimated could 
cost up to $10 million each year in the 
first two years of implementation. This 
NPRM proposes to require payment 
within 21 days of receiving a completed 
invoice for services. The 21-day 
deadline was established in the 2016 
CCDF final rule. 81 FR 67516–17. 
However, some child care providers 
continue to express concerns about 
receiving payments so long after 
services were provided and noted they 
sometimes choose not to participate in 
CCDF or limit the number of children 
receiving CCDF that they will care for 
because of delays in payments, harming 
parental choice.
4
Therefore, we request 
comment on whether a different 
deadline, such as seven days or 14 days 
after receiving a completed invoice, 
would more effectively balance the need 
to provide Lead Agency flexibility while 
also supporting provider stability. 
Delinking Payments from Absences. 
The NPRM proposes to eliminate the 
requirement at § 98.45(m)(2) for States 
and Territories to base payments on a 
child’s authorized enrollment and 
would return to the options included in 
the 2016 final rule. By returning to 
previous regulatory language, Lead 
Agencies would have more options to 
meet the statutory requirement at 
Section 658E(c)(2)(S)(ii) of the Act (42 
U.S.C. 9858c(c)(2)(S)(ii)) to support the 
fixed costs of providing child care

services by delinking provider payment 
rates from an eligible child’s occasional 
absences due to holidays or unforeseen 
circumstances such as illness, to the 
extent practicable. Paragraph 
98.45(m)(2), as proposed, would specify 
that Lead Agencies may meet this 
statutory requirement by: (1) Paying 
providers based on a child’s enrollment, 
rather than attendance; (2) providing a 
full payment to providers as long as a 
child attends for 85 percent of the 
authorized time; (3) providing full 
payment to providers as long as a child 
is absent for five or fewer days in a four 
week period; or (4) establishing an 
alternative approach justified in the 
CCDF Plan. Based on FFY 2025–2027 
CCDF State and Territory Plan data, 28 
States and one Territory do not pay all 
provider types based on enrollment. The 
proposed changes would not impact a 
Lead Agency’s ability to choose to pay 
providers based on a child’s authorized 
enrollment, and Lead Agencies that 
currently pay providers based on 
enrollment may continue to do so. 
This NPRM proposes to provide 
additional flexibility for Lead Agencies 
in how they meet the requirement to 
delink provider payments from absence 
days by reverting to the four options 
established in the 2016 final rule. In the 
time since publication of the 2016 final 
rule, child care providers have 
expressed that the uncertainty of 
whether they will be paid for a child’s 
absence days makes it difficult to budget 
and manage business expenses, leading 
them to opt-out of participating in the 
CCDF program.
5
State subsidy policies 
like paying for absence days can 
increase revenue and improve budget 
stability for child care programs. These 
policies may result in higher rates of 
participation in the CCDF program 
among providers, leading to more 
choices for families using CCDF voucher 
payments for care.
6
As with timely 
payments, we are seeking comment on 
whether a different number of paid 
absences, such as ten days instead of 
five days in a month, and/or different 
attendance rate, such as 75 percent of 
authorized time instead of 85 percent of 
authorized time, would increase child 
care provider participation in the CCDF 
program, while ensuring Lead Agency 
flexibility. 
Restructuring to Align with Previous 
Regulations. This NPRM proposes to revise § 98.45 to revert to the paragraph 
structure of the 2016 final rule. First, the 
NPRM proposes to move language from 
the introduction at § 98.45(m) requiring 
provider payment practices to reflect 
generally accepted payment practices to 
§ 98.45(m)(3). This proposed change 
aligns with regulatory language in the 
2016 final rule, which included this text 
when describing the requirement to pay 
providers based on a part-time or full- 
time basis and to pay for reasonable 
mandatory fees. This paragraph 
structure change would not change 
requirements related to paying 
providers on a part-time or full-time 
basis or to pay for reasonable mandatory 
fees. Second, the NPRM would remove 
language at § 98.45(n)(4) that indicates 
Lead Agencies are able to take 
‘‘precautionary measures when a 
provider is suspected of fiscal 
mismanagement.’’ This language was 
added to clarify flexibility available to 
States and Territories to adjust policies 
for required prospective payments and 
paying by enrollment when providers 
are suspected of fraud. Given this NPRM 
proposes to give States and Territories 
more flexibility with payment practices, 
the language will not be necessary once 
these changes are finalized. Lead 
Agencies would have sufficient 
flexibility in the revised regulatory 
language for payment practices to adjust 
payment policies in response to 
suspected provider fraud. Lastly, the 
NPRM proposes to remove paragraphs 
§ 98.45(n)(4) and (5), combine 
§ 98.45(m)(3) and (4) under a revised 
§ 98.45(m)(3), and redesignate the 
provisions at § 98.45(n)(1)–(3) as 
§ 98.45(m)(4)–(6). 
Clarification on Total Payment to 
Providers. The NPRM proposes to remove language at § 98.45(n)(5) to 
require Lead Agencies to demonstrate in 
their CCDF Plan that the total payment 
to a provider (subsidy payment amount 
and family co-payment) is not impacted 
by cost-sharing policies. In other words, 
Lead Agencies had to describe how the 
provider’s subsidy payment would not 
decrease because of the lower family co- 
payments. This clarification was 
included in the March 2024 final rule in 
response to comments on the 
requirement at § 98.45(l)(3) to limit 
family co-payments to 7 percent of 
family income and concerns that 
reductions in family co-payments could 
reduce the amount received by child 
care providers. Given that the proposed 
changes would remove the requirement 
for States and Territories to limit family 
co-payments to 7 percent of family 
income, this clarification would no 
longer be needed. Lead Agencies would 
continue to be required to set payment 
rates at levels that provide CCDF 
families equal access to child care 
services that are comparable to care 
provided to children whose parents are 
not eligible for CCDF. 
Subpart F—Use of Child Care and 
Development Funds 
§ 98.50 Child Care Services 
This NPRM proposes to revise 
§ 98.50(a)(3) by deleting ‘‘including 
grants or contracts for slots for children 
in underserved geographic areas, for 
infants and toddlers, and children with 
disabilities. Grants solely to improve the 
quality of child care services like those 
in (b) of this section would not satisfy 
the requirements at § 98.30(b).’’ This 
proposed deletion conforms with the 
proposed rescission at § 98.30(b), 
discussed earlier in this preamble, that 
would remove the requirement for Lead 
Agencies to provide some child care 
services through grants or contracts. 
This NPRM also proposes conforming 
changes at § 98.50(b) by deleting ‘‘the 
following designated amounts cannot be 
used to satisfy the requirements at 
§ 98.30(b)’’ from the introductory 
language and deleting (b)(4) completely. 
This regulatory language would no 
longer be relevant if the proposed 
change to remove the requirement for 
grants or contracts is finalized. 
Subpart I—Indian Tribes 
This subpart addresses requirements 
and procedures for Indian Tribes and 
Tribal organizations applying for or 
receiving CCDF funds and serves as the 
Tribal summary impact statement as 
required by Executive Order 13175.
7
 
The proposed amendments in this 
subpart are conforming changes and 
would not change requirements for 
Tribal CCDF Lead Agencies. 
§ 98.81 Application and Plan 
Procedures and § 98.83 Requirements 
for Tribal Programs 
Paragraphs 98.81(b)(6) and 98.83(d)(1) 
specify from which provisions all Tribal 
Lead Agencies are exempted. All Tribal 
Lead Agencies are already exempted 
from the previous requirement to 
provide some direct services through 
grants or contracts. Because this NPRM 
would rescind the requirements for 
States and Territories to provide 
services through grants or contracts, the 
provisions exempting Tribal Lead

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS212 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules Agencies from the requirement would 
no longer be necessary. Therefore, this 
NPRM proposes to remove 
§§ 98.81(b)(6)(x), 98.83(d)(1)(i), and 
98.83(d)(1)(x). 
The NPRM does not propose changes 
to § 98.83(d)(1)(vi), which exempts all 
Tribal Lead Agencies from the 
requirement for a sliding fee scale at 
§ 98.45(l). However, as discussed above, 
the proposed change would remove the 
requirement for Tribal Lead Agencies 
with medium and large allocations that 
choose to implement cost-sharing and 
require family co-payments for their 
CCDF programs to cap family co- 
payments to 7 percent of the family’s 
income. Currently, no Tribal Lead 
Agencies with medium or large 
allocations set their family co-payments 
above 7 percent of the family’s income. 
Therefore, this proposed change would 
have no immediate impact on Tribal 
Lead Agencies. Tribes with small 
allocations were already exempt from 
the requirement to limit family co- 
payments to 7 percent of income. If the 
proposed change is finalized, all Tribal 
Lead Agencies would have maximum 
flexibility in establishing those co- 
payment amounts. 
V. Regulatory Process Matters 
Paperwork Reduction Act 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., as 
amended) (PRA), all Departments are 
required to submit to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for 
review and approval any reporting or 
recordkeeping requirements inherent in 
a proposed or final rule. As required by 
this Act, we will submit any proposed 
revised data collection requirements to 
OMB for review and approval. 
The proposed changes would modify 
the previously approved ACF–118 
CCDF State and Territory Plan 
information collection, but ACF has not 
yet initiated the OMB approval process 
to implement these changes. ACF will 
publish a Federal Register notice 
soliciting public comment on specific 
revisions to this information collection 
and the associated burden estimate and 
will make available the proposed form 
and instructions for review.

Executive Order 13132 
Executive Order 13132 requires 
federal agencies to consult with State 
and local government officials if they 
develop regulatory policies with 
federalism implications. Federalism is 
rooted in the belief that issues that are 
not national in scope or significance are 
most appropriately addressed by the 
level of government close to the people. 
This proposed rule would not have 
substantial direct impact on the States, 
on the relationship between the federal 
government and the States, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various 
levels of government. This NPRM would 
not pre-empt State law. The changes 
proposed in the NPRM are increasing 
flexibilities in administering the CCDF 
program. Therefore, in accordance with 
section 6 of Executive Order 13132, it is 
determined that this action does not 
have sufficient federalism implications 
to warrant the preparation of a 
federalism summary impact statement. 
Assessment of Federal Regulations and 
Policies on Families 
Assessment of Federal Regulations 
and Policies on Families Section 654 of 
the Treasury and General Government 
Appropriations Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 
105–277) requires federal agencies to 
determine whether a policy or 
regulation may negatively affect family 
well-being. If the agency determines a 
policy or regulation negatively affects 
family well-being, then the agency must 
prepare an impact assessment 
addressing seven criteria specified in 
the law. HHS believes it is not necessary 
to prepare a family policymaking 
assessment because the actions 
proposed in this NPRM will not have 
any impact on the autonomy or integrity 
of the family as an institution. 
VI. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
Introduction 
We have examined the impacts of the 
NPRM under Executive Order 12866, 
Executive Order 13563, Executive Order 
14192, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 
1531 et seq.). Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 
direct us to assess all benefits and costs 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
when regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits. This proposed rule was 
determined to be significant under 
Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. 
Executive Order 14192 requires that any 
new incremental costs associated with 
significant new regulations ‘‘shall, to the 
extent permitted by law, be offset by the 
elimination of existing costs associated 
with at least ten prior regulations.’’ This 
NRPM is considered an E.O. 14192 
deregulatory action. We estimate that

this NPRM will generate $6.1 million in 
annualized cost savings at a 7 percent 
discount rate, discounted relative to 
year 2024, over a perpetual time 
horizon. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) 
requires agencies to consider the impact 
of their regulatory proposals on small 
entities. Consistent with certification of 
the March 2024 final rule, the Secretary 
certifies that the changes proposed by 
this NPRM would not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. 
The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995 (UMRA) generally requires that 
each agency conduct a cost-benefit 
analysis; identify and consider a 
reasonable number of regulatory 
alternatives; and select the least costly, 
most cost-effective, or least burdensome 
alternative that achieves the objectives 
of the rule before promulgating any 
proposed or final rule that includes a 
Federal mandate that may result in 
expenditures of more than $100 million 
(adjusted for inflation) in at least one 
year by State, local, and Tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the 
private sector. Each agency issuing a 
rule with relevant effects over that 
threshold must also seek input from 
State, local, and Tribal governments. 
The current threshold after adjustment 
for inflation is $187 million, using the 
most current (2024) Implicit Price 
Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. 
This NPRM will not result in an 
expenditure in any year that meets or 
exceeds this amount. 
Background and Summary of Economic 
Impacts 
On July 13, 2023, ACF published a 
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) 
that proposed revisions to Child Care 
and Development Fund (CCDF) 
regulations.
8
After considering the 
public comments, on March 1, 2024, 
ACF published a published a final rule 
that made regulatory changes to CCDF 
(‘‘March 2024 final rule’’),
9
which 
contained a regulatory impact analysis 
(2024 RIA) that reported monetary 
estimates of the economic impacts. 
Through this NPRM, ACF is proposing 
to rescind or modify several of the 
mandatory provisions of the March 2024 
final rule including those relating to 
enrollment-based payment, 7 percent 
cap on co-payments, prospective 
payments, and grants or contracts for 
direct services. As a starting point for 
analyzing the impact of this NPRM, we 
adopt the estimated economic impacts 
in the March 2024 final rule as 
capturing the baseline scenario of no 
further regulatory action. Table 1 reports 
yearly transfers and costs associated 
with the relevant requirements of the 
March 2024 final rule.
10
While the 
prospective payments policy does not 
appear as a separate line item in this 
analysis, its impacts were accounted for 
in the ‘‘systems’’ cost estimate included 
in the March 2024 final rule.

regulations added by the March 2024 
final rule, this NPRM would prevent the 
occurrence of the estimated transfers 
and costs reported in the 2024 RIA, with 
the exception of the anticipated 
economic impacts in the first year. For 
the purposes of this analysis, we assume 
those impacts have already occurred 
and cannot be recovered, or did not 
occur as the result of a temporary 
transitional waiver of the requirements 
granted to some States. Thus, when 
considering the economic impacts of 
this NPRM, we do not report any 
impacts on transfers or costs in 2025. In 
subsequent years, we report the inverse 
of the monetary estimates identified in 
Table 1 as the impacts of the NPRM. 
Table 2 reports these estimates, where 
negative costs represent cost savings, 
and negative transfers represent a 
reversal of the direction of transfers 
compared to the 2024 RIA. In this 
context, transfers under the March 2024 
final rule that represented increases in 
Lead Agency payments to child care 
providers represent reductions in Lead 
Agency payments to child care 
providers.

and annualized costs of ¥$6.7 million 
using a 3-percent discount rate and 
¥$6.6 million using a 7 percent

cost savings under E.O. 14192, we 
assume the impacts of the proposed 
changes on costs in 2029 will extend in 
perpetuity. We estimate that this NPRM 
will generate $6.1 million in annualized 
cost savings at a 7 percent discount rate, 
discounted relative to year 2024, in 
perpetuity. 
VII. Tribal Consultation Statement 
Executive Order 13175, Consultation 
and Coordination with Indian Tribal 
Governments, requires agencies to 
consult with Indian Tribes when 
regulations have substantial direct 
effects on one or more Indian tribes, on 
the relationship between the Federal 
government and Indian tribes, or on the 
distribution of power and 
responsibilities between the Federal 
Government and Indian Tribes. The 
discussion in subpart I in section IV of 
the preamble serves as the Tribal impact 
statement. We intend to notify Tribal 
Lead Agencies about the opportunity to 
provide comment on the NPRM no later 
than the day of publication.

programs. 
For the reasons set forth in the 
preamble, ACF proposes to amend 45 
CFR part 98 as follows: 
PART 98—CHILD CARE AND 
DEVELOPMENT FUND 
1. The authority citation for part 98 is 
revised to read: 
Authority: 42 U.S.C. 618, 9857 et seq. * * * * * 
2. Amend § 98.16 by: 
a. Revising paragraph (x); 
b. Removing paragraphs (y) and (z); 
c. Redesignating paragraphs (aa) 
through (ll) as paragraphs (y) through 
(jj): and, 
d. Revising newly redesignated 
paragraph (cc). 
The revisions read as follows: 
§ 98.16 Plan provisions. 
* * * * * 
(x) A description of the Lead Agency’s 
strategies (which may include 
alternative payment rates to child care 
providers, the provision of direct grants 
or contracts, offering child care 
certificates, or other means) to increase 
the supply and improve the quality of 
child care services for children in 
underserved areas, infants and toddlers, 
children with disabilities as defined by 
the Lead Agency, and children who 
receive care during nontraditional 
hours, including whether the Lead 
Agency plans to use grants and 
contracts in building supply and how 
supply-building mechanisms will 
address the needs identified. The 
description must identify shortages in 
the supply of high-quality child care 
providers, list the data sources used to 
identify shortages, and describe the 
method of tracking progress to support 
equal access and parental choice. If the 
Lead Agency chooses to employ grants 
and contracts to meet the purposes of 
this section, the Lead Agency must 
provide CCDF families the option to 
choose a certificate for the purpose of 
acquiring care; 
* * * * * 
(cc) A description of payment 
practices applicable to providers of 
child care services for which assistance 
is provided under this part, pursuant to 
§ 98.45(m), including practices to ensure 
timely payment for services, to delink 
provider payments from children’s 
occasional absences to the extent 
practicable, and to reflect generally- 
accepted payment practices; 
* * * * * 
3. Amend § 98.30 by revising 
paragraph (b) to read as follows: 
§ 98.30 Parental choice. 
* * * * * 
(b) When a parent elects to enroll the 
child with a provider that has a grant or 
contract for the provision of child care 
services, the child will be enrolled with 
the provider selected by the parent to 
the maximum extent practicable. 
* * * * * 
4. Amend § 98.45 by: 
a. Revising paragraphs (b)(5), (l)(3), 
and (m); and 
b. Removing paragraph (n). 
The revisions read as follows: 
§ 98.45 Equal access. 
* * * * * 
(b) * * * 
(5) How co-payments based on a 
sliding fee scale are affordable, as 
stipulated at paragraph (l) of this 
section; if applicable, a rationale for the 
Lead Agency’s policy on whether child 
care providers may charge additional 
amounts to families above the required 
family co-payment, including a 
demonstration that the policy promotes 
affordability and access; analysis of the 
interaction between any such additional 
amounts with the required family co- 
payments, and of the ability of subsidy 
payment rates to provide access to care 
without additional fees; and data on the 
extent to which CCDF providers charge 
such additional amounts (based on 
information obtained in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(2) of this section); 
* * * * * 
(l) *** 
(3) Provides for affordable family co- 
payments that are not a barrier to 
families receiving assistance under this 
part; and 
* * * * * 
(m) The Lead Agency shall 
demonstrate in the Plan that it has 
established payment practices 
applicable to all CCDF child care 
providers that: 
(1) Ensure timeliness of payment by 
either: 
(i) Paying prospectively prior to the 
delivery of services; or 
(ii) Paying within no more than 21 
calendar days of the receipt of a 
complete invoice for services. 
(2) To the extent practicable, support 
the fixed costs of providing child care 
services by delinking provider payments 
from a child’s occasional absences by: 
(i) Paying based on a child’s 
enrollment rather than attendance; 
(ii) Providing full payment if a child 
attends at least 85 percent of the 
authorized time; 
(iii) Providing full payment if a child 
is absent for five or fewer days in a 
month; or, 
(ii) An alternative approach for which 
the Lead Agency provides a justification 
in its Plan. 
(3) Reflect generally accepted 
payment practices of child care 
providers that serve children who do 
not receive CCDF subsidies, which must 
include (unless the Lead Agency 
provides evidence that such practices 
are not generally-accepted in the State 
or service area): 
(i) Paying on a part-time or full-time 
basis (rather than paying for hours of 
service or smaller increments of time); 
and 
(ii) Paying for reasonable mandatory 
registration fees that the provider 
charges to private-paying parents. 
(4) Ensure child care providers 
receive payment for any services in 
accordance with a written payment 
agreement or authorization for services 
that includes, at a minimum, 
information regarding payment policies, 
including rates, schedules, any fees 
charged to providers, and the dispute

Atlantic Highly Migratory Species; 
Revisions to Commercial Atlantic 
Blacknose and Recreational Atlantic 
Shark Fisheries Management 
Measures 
AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 
Commerce. 
ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. 
SUMMARY: NMFS is proposing several changes for commercial and recreational 
Atlantic shark fisheries. Specifically, 
NMFS is considering options to remove 
the blacknose shark management 
boundary in the Atlantic region, modify 
the commercial retention limit for 
blacknose sharks in the Atlantic region, 
revise the recreational minimum size 
limits for Atlantic shark species, and 
revise the recreational retention limits 
for Atlantic shark species. In this action, 
NMFS would also remove commercial 
management group quota linkages, 
consistent with Amendment 14 to the 
2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly 
Migratory Species (HMS) Fishery 
Management Plan (FMP), and make 
technical changes to clarify certain HMS 
regulations. This action is responsive to 
the framework for implementing 
management measures established in 
Amendment 14, findings from the 
Atlantic Shark Fishery Review (SHARE) 
document, public comments from 
scoping for Amendment 16 to the HMS 
FMP, and recent domestic laws and 
international agreements that are having 
direct and indirect impacts on shark 
fisheries. The goal of this action is to 
increase management flexibility to react 
to changes in the Atlantic shark 
fisheries and optimize the ability of the 
commercial and recreational shark 
fisheries to harvest quota to the extent 
practicable.

responsible for managing Federal 
Atlantic HMS fisheries (i.e., sharks, tunas, billfish and swordfish), pursuant 
to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act 
(Magnuson-Stevens Act) (16 U.S.C. 1801 
et seq.) and consistent with the Atlantic 
Tunas Convention Act (ATCA) (16 
U.S.C. 971 et seq.). The term HMS is 
defined at 16 U.S.C. 1802(21), and the 
provisions for the management of HMS 
are found at 16 U.S.C. 1854(g)(1). ATCA 
is the implementing statute for binding 
recommendations of the International 
Commission for the Conservation of 
Atlantic Tunas. NMFS manages HMS 
fisheries under the HMS FMP and its 
amendments. HMS implementing 
regulations are at 50 CFR part 635.

Atlantic shark species under appendix II 
of the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild

rule, NMFS is considering options to 
remove the blacknose shark 
management boundary in the Atlantic 
region, modify the commercial retention 
limit for blacknose sharks in the 
Atlantic region, revise the recreational 
minimum size limits for Atlantic shark 
species, and revise the recreational

species. In this action, NMFS would 
also remove commercial management 
group quota linkages consistent with 
Amendment 14 and make technical 
changes to clarify certain HMS 
regulations. The goal of this action is to 
increase management flexibility to react 
to additional factors affecting Atlantic 
shark fisheries and optimize the ability 
of the commercial and recreational 
shark fisheries to harvest available quota 
to the extent practicable. 
NMFS has prepared a draft 
Environmental Assessment (EA), 
Regulatory Impact Review (RIR), and an 
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(IRFA), which present the alternatives 
considered for this proposed rule and 
analyze their anticipated environmental, 
social, and economic impacts. A brief 
summary of background information 
and the alternatives considered is

regarding this action and Atlantic shark 
management overall can be found in the 
draft EA/RIR/IRFA, the HMS FMP and 
its amendments, the annual HMS Stock 
Assessment and Fishery Evaluation 
Reports, and online at: https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/topic/atlantic- 
highly-migratory-species. 
Statutory Authority 
The Magnuson-Stevens Act requires 
measures necessary for the conservation 
and management of the fishery to be 
consistent with the 10 National 
Standards set forth in 16 U.S.C. 1851(a). 
Specific to the objectives of this action, 
the National Standards state that 
measures must do the following: 
prevent overfishing while achieving 
optimum yield from the fishery 
(National Standard 1); be based on the 
best scientific information available 
(National Standard 2); to the extent 
practicable, manage the stock 
throughout its range and manage 
interrelated stocks as a unit or in close 
coordination (National Standard 3); take 
into account and allow for variations 
among fisheries, fishery resources, and 
catches (National Standard 6); and 
minimize bycatch, and, to the extent 
bycatch cannot be avoided, minimize 
the mortality of bycatch (National 
Standard 9). Furthermore, the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for 
management actions to designate zones 
where, and periods when, fishing shall 
be limited, or shall not be permitted, or 
shall be permitted only by specified 
types of fishing vessels or with specified 
types and quantities of fishing gear (16 
U.S.C. 1853(b)(2)(A)). The Magnuson- 
Stevens Act also allows for management 
actions to establish specified limitations 
which are necessary and appropriate on 
the catch of fish (based on area, species, 
size, number, weight, sex, bycatch, total 
biomass, or other factors) (16 U.S.C. 
1853(b)(3)(A)). 
Background 
NMFS finalized the first FMP for 
Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean in 1993 
(1993 FMP) (58 FR 21931, April 26, 
1993). The 1993 FMP established many 
of the management measures still in 
place today, including management 
complexes, commercial quotas, and 
recreational minimum size and 
retention limits. NMFS then revised the 
1993 FMP to include swordfish and 
tunas in the 1999 FMP for Atlantic 
Tunas, Swordfish, and Sharks (64 FR 
29090, May 28, 1999), which included 
numerous measures to rebuild or 
prevent overfishing of sharks in 
commercial and recreational fisheries 
(1999 FMP). The 1999 FMP, among 
other things, established a recreational 
minimum size limit for most shark 
species of 54 inches (137 centimeters 
(cm)) fork length (FL) and reduced 
recreational retention limits for all 
sharks to one shark per vessel per trip. 
In 2006, NMFS consolidated the 
Atlantic Tunas, Swordfish, and Shark 
FMP and its amendments with the 
Atlantic Billfish FMP and its 
amendments into the HMS FMP (71 FR 
58058, October 2, 2006). Since then, 17 
amendments to the HMS FMP have 
been made or initiated. 
In 2008, NMFS implemented 
Amendment 2 to the HMS FMP (73 FR 
40657, July 7, 2008, corrected at 73 FR 
40658, July 15, 2008), which included, 
among other things, management 
measures that expanded the shark 
species authorized for recreational 
retention and modified recreational 
retention limits. The shark species then 
authorized for recreational retention 
included tiger sharks, non-ridgeback 
large coastal sharks (LCS) (i.e., blacktip, spinner, bull, lemon, nurse, great 
hammerhead, smooth hammerhead, and 
scalloped hammerhead sharks), small 
coastal sharks (SCS) (bonnethead, 
Atlantic sharpnose, finetooth, and 
blacknose sharks), and pelagic sharks 
(i.e., shortfin mako, common thresher, oceanic whitetip, blue, and porbeagle 
sharks). Recreational retention limits 
were set at one Atlantic sharpnose shark 
and one bonnethead shark per person 
per trip with no minimum size limit, 
and one per person per vessel for all 
other authorized shark species greater 
than 54 inches (137 cm) FL. 
Amendment 2 also set commercial 
retention limits to no limit for SCS for 
Directed shark limited access permit 
(LAP) holders and 16 SCS for Incidental 
shark LAP holders. 
In 2007, Southeast Data, Assessment, 
and Review (SEDAR) completed a stock 
assessment for SCS (SEDAR 13). 
Consequently, NMFS determined 
blacknose sharks to be overfished with 
overfishing occurring (73 FR 25665, 
May 7, 2008). NMFS then implemented 
management measures in Amendment 3 
to the HMS FMP (75 FR 30484, June 1, 
2010) to, among other things, rebuild 
and end overfishing of blacknose sharks. 
Specifically, Amendment 3 linked the 
non-blacknose SCS and blacknose shark 
fisheries so that both fisheries would 
close when landings of either reached 
80 percent of its quota. 
In 2010, SEDAR conducted another 
stock assessment on blacknose sharks 
(SEDAR 21, 2011) and identified two 
separate stocks of blacknose sharks (one 
in the Atlantic Ocean and one in the 
Gulf of America). Accordingly, NMFS 
determined the Atlantic stock of 
blacknose sharks to be overfished with 
overfishing occurring, and, the Gulf of 
America stock of blacknose sharks to 
have an unknown stock status. Thus, 
NMFS developed Amendment 5a to the 
HMS FMP (78 FR 40317, July 3, 2013), 
in part, to address overfishing and 
rebuild the Atlantic blacknose shark 
stock. Consistent with the stock 
assessment determination, Amendment 
5a divided the blacknose and non- 
blacknose SCS quotas into separate 
regional quotas (i.e., Atlantic and Gulf of America). In the commercial shark 
fishery, NMFS established regional 
quota linkages between management

together to prevent exceeding newly 
established quotas through discarded 
bycatch. In the recreational shark 
fishery, NMFS set the minimum size 
limit for all hammerhead sharks to 78 
inches (198.1 cm) FL. 
In 2015, NMFS implemented 
Amendment 6 to the HMS FMP (80 FR 
50073, August 18, 2015), which, among 
other things, established a management 
boundary in the Atlantic region along 
lat. 34°00 N (approximately at Wilmington, North Carolina) for the SCS 
shark fishery, maintained SCS quota 
linkages south of the lat. 34°00 N management boundary, and prohibited 
the retention of blacknose sharks north 
of the lat. 34°00 N management boundary. Also in 2015, NMFS 
implemented Amendment 9 to the HMS 
FMP (80 FR 73128, November 24, 2015) 
which, among other things, established 
management measures for smoothhound 
sharks in the Atlantic and Gulf of 
America regions. Specifically, in the 
recreational shark fishery, Amendment 
9 established no retention limit for 
smoothhound sharks (i.e., smooth dogfish) with no minimum size limit. 
In 2017, NMFS implemented a final 
rule (81 FR 90241, December 14, 2016) 
that established a commercial retention 
limit of eight blacknose sharks for all 
Directed and Incidental shark LAP 
holders in the Atlantic region south of 
lat. 34°00 N. The intent of this action was to maximize the utilization of the 
non-blacknose SCS quota while 
minimizing mortality and discards of 
blacknose sharks, consistent with the 
existing rebuilding plan, and other SCS. 
In 2023, NMFS finalized Amendment 
14 (88 FR 4157, January 24, 2023), 
which, among other things, revised the 
framework for establishing quotas and 
related management measures for 
Atlantic shark fisheries, and 
incorporated for potential use several 
optional fishery management tools that 
were adopted in the revised guidelines 
for implementing National Standard 1 of 
the Magnuson-Stevens Act (81 FR 
71858, October 18, 2016). Specifically, 
Amendment 14 modified the general 
procedures for establishing the 
acceptable biological catch and annual 
catch limits (ACL), and included 
measures to actively monitor all 
commercial and recreational sector 
ACLs. NMFS anticipates that the revised 
framework for establishing quota and 
related management measures for 
Atlantic shark fisheries, as established 
in Amendment 14, may be implemented 
through Amendment 16. 
In 2023, NMFS conducted scoping to 
identify significant issues related to the 
management of Atlantic shark fisheries 
(88 FR 29617, May 8, 2023). The 
scoping document for Amendment 16 
considered extensive changes to 
commercial and recreational shark 
fisheries’ management. The 
management options presented for 
public comment included changes to 
commercial and recreational shark 
management measures related to 
commercial and recreational quotas, 
management groups, retention limits, 
and size limits. During scoping for 
Amendment 16, a number of 
commenters noted that Amendment 16 
was too large and recommended that 
NMFS split management measures into 
multiple smaller actions. As such, 
NMFS decided to remove some actions 
from Amendment 16 and consider them 
separately in this rule. Thus, NMFS has 
already received input on many of the 
management options considered in this 
action from the public, including fishery 
participants and the HMS Advisory 
Panel. NMFS does not expect to release 
Draft Amendment 16 and the associated 
proposed rule until early 2026. 
Proposed Measures 
NMFS is proposing to (1) remove the 
blacknose shark management boundary 
in the Atlantic region; (2) modify the 
commercial retention limit for 
blacknose sharks in the Atlantic region; 
(3) revise the recreational minimum size 
limits for Atlantic shark species; and (4) 
revise the recreational retention limits 
for Atlantic shark species. As described 
below, NMFS considered two 
alternatives concerning the blacknose 
shark management boundary, three 
alternatives concerning the blacknose 
shark commercial retention limit, five 
alternatives concerning recreational 
minimum size limits, and three 
alternatives concerning recreational 
retention limits. These alternatives 
included both no action and the 
preferred alternatives. The purpose of 
this action is to increase management 
flexibility to react to additional factors 
affecting Atlantic shark fisheries and 
optimize the ability of the commercial 
and recreational shark fisheries to 
harvest available quota to the extent 
practicable. 
Blacknose Shark Management 
Boundary in the Atlantic Region 
NMFS is proposing, under preferred 
Alternative A2, to remove the lat. 34°00 
N blacknose shark management 
boundary in the Atlantic region. Under 
this alternative, vessels issued a 
Directed or Incidental shark LAP would 
be able to commercially harvest 
blacknose sharks in the entire Atlantic 
region. Currently, vessels issued a 
Directed or Incidental shark LAP can 
commercially harvest blacknose sharks 
only south of lat. 34°00 N (Alternative A1). 
NMFS originally implemented this 
management boundary under 
Amendment 6 in order, in part, to keep 
the non-blacknose SCS fishery open if 
there is available quota. The blacknose 
and non-blacknose SCS fisheries are 
linked management groups, and at the 
time, a high volume of blacknose shark 
landings was leading to early closures of 
both fisheries. The blacknose shark 
management boundary allowed the non- 
blacknose SCS fishery to remain open, 
north of lat. 34°00 N, regardless of blacknose shark landings. However, in 
recent years, landings of both blacknose 
and non-blacknose SCS have decreased 
and neither fishery has closed early nor 
has either quota been fully harvested. 
From 2017 through 2022, commercial 
fishermen harvested on average 
approximately 36 percent of the 
blacknose shark commercial quota. 
Additionally, as blacknose shark 
migratory patterns continue to expand 
northward in the Atlantic region (i.e., 
north of the current blacknose shark 
management boundary), maintaining the 
blacknose shark management boundary 
may increase the number of blacknose 
sharks discarded dead. These dead 
discards are more likely to occur if 
fishermen who catch blacknose sharks 
cannot retain them under their existing 
fishing permit(s) and they are dissuaded 
from obtaining an applicable fishing 
permit due to the management 
boundary. Removing the blacknose 
shark management boundary in the 
Atlantic region, under preferred 
Alternative A2, would facilitate full 
utilization of the available blacknose 
shark quota and be consistent with the 
removal of the quota linkages as 
approved in Amendment 14 (see the 
Miscellaneous Regulatory Changes and 
Related Rulemaking section for more 
information). 
Blacknose Shark Commercial Retention 
Limit in the Atlantic Region 
NMFS is proposing, under preferred 
Alternative B2, to establish a flexible 
commercial retention limit of 0 to 60 
blacknose sharks per vessel per trip for 
vessels issued a Directed shark LAP in 
the Atlantic region. The default 
commercial retention limit that would 
apply at the start of each fishing year 
would be 25 blacknose sharks per vessel 
per trip for vessels issued a Directed 
shark LAP in the Atlantic region. Under 
the preferred alternative, NMFS would 
monitor the fishery and could adjust the 
commercial retention limit during the 
fishing year, based on the inseason trip 
limit adjustment criteria at 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:07 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00013 Fmt 4702 Sfmt 4702 E:\FR\FM\05JAP1.SGM 05JAP1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS218 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules § 635.24(a)(8). The current commercial 
retention limit (Alternative B1) is fixed 
at eight blacknose sharks per vessel per 
trip. As described above, under the 
current retention limit, the commercial 
quota has been under harvested for 
several years. Additionally, commercial 
fishermen often catch more blacknose 
sharks per trip than can be harvested 
under the current retention limit, 
leading to regulatory discards. The 
ability to adjust the retention limit 
throughout the fishing year could allow 
the quota to be fully harvested while 
also limiting dead discards. NMFS is 
not considering changes to the 
blacknose shark commercial retention 
limit for vessels used an Incidental 
shark LAP in the Atlantic region (i.e., 
eight blacknose sharks per vessel per 
trip) in this action. 
NMFS used a maximum commercial 
retention limit of 60 blacknose sharks 
per vessel per trip for preferred 
Alternative B2 based on the Southeast 
Fisheries Science Center Observer 
Program data from 2017 through 2022, 
which showed that commercial 
fishermen fishing with gillnet and 
bottom longline gears have interacted 
with up to 54 blacknose sharks on a 
single trip in the Atlantic region. A 
maximum commercial retention limit of 
60 blacknose sharks per vessel per trip 
encompasses the maximum number of 
blacknose shark interactions observed 
on a commercial fishing trip in the last 
several years, and therefore would 
minimize regulatory discards and 
maximize the efficiency of trips. A 
maximum of 60 would also include an 
added buffer for management flexibility, 
should interactions increase or other 
conditions change that warrant a higher 
retention limit. 
NMFS used a default commercial 
retention limit of 25 blacknose sharks 
for preferred Alternative B2 based on a 
number of factors, including the 
commercial blacknose shark quota, 
fishing trends from the most active 
participants in the fishery, and 
interactions between blacknose sharks 
and commercial fishermen in the 
Atlantic region. The commercial 
blacknose shark quota is 37,921 pounds 
(lb) dressed weight (dw) (17.2 metric 
tons (mt) dw) and, based on Southeast 
Fisheries Science Center Observer 
Program data from 2017 through 2022, 
the average weight of a blacknose shark 
landed on commercial trips is 11.4 lb 
dw (0.01 mt dw). NMFS based the 
analysis for this alternative on the five 
vessels that land the majority of 
blacknose sharks because they are the 
fishery participants that target blacknose 
sharks on their fishing trips, whereas 
the remaining fishery participants 
generally opportunistically retain only 
incidentally caught blacknose sharks. 
Thus, it would take landing 
approximately 3,326 sharks to harvest 
the blacknose shark quota (37,921 lb dw 
(17,2 mt lb)/11.4 lb dw (0.01 mt dw) 
average per shark = 3,326.4 sharks). 
According to the HMS electronic dealer 
reporting system (eDealer) data from 
2017 through 2022, 5 vessels account for 
the majority (78 percent) of blacknose 
shark landings and take an average of 
137 trips a year. Thus, NMFS calculated 
that the top 5 most active vessels in the 
fishery could retain as many as 24 
blacknose sharks per vessel per trip to 
harvest the blacknose shark quota 
without a fishery closure (3,326 sharks/ 
137 trips = 24.3 sharks/trip). NMFS 
prefers a default commercial retention 
limit of 25 blacknose sharks per vessel 
per trip to optimize the number of 
blacknose sharks that could be retained 
per trip without significantly impacting 
the total number of fishing trips that 
could be taken in a given year to land 
the full quota. Additionally, a default 
retention limit of 25 blacknose sharks 
provides a buffer so Directed shark LAP 
holders can retain most or all blacknose 
shark catch on any given fishing trip. 
Recreational Minimum Size Limits 
NMFS is proposing, under preferred 
Alternative C4, to group certain shark 
species together and establish a 
recreational minimum size limit range 
for each group. Under this preferred 
alternative, the default recreational 
minimum size limit would be based on 
a midpoint value of the female sizes at 
maturity for the shark species in that 
group, or else it would remain 
consistent with current HMS regulations 
(§ 635.20(e)). The recreational minimum 
size limit range would encompass the 
female sizes at maturity for all shark 
species in each group, and allow the 
minimum size limit to be set above the 
female sizes at maturity for each group. 
This proposed approach is a change 
from the status quo (Alternative C1) 
where all sharks, unless otherwise 
specified, must be at least 54 inches 
(137 cm) FL; all hammerhead sharks 
must be at least 78 inches (198.1 cm) FL; 
and there is no size limit for Atlantic 
sharpnose, bonnethead, or 
smoothhound sharks. 
Under preferred Alternative C4, 
NMFS grouped shark species based on 
a number of factors, including species 
that look similar, have similar sizes at 
maturity, or anglers could catch them in 
similar areas using similar fishing 
techniques. NMFS used the following 
rationale for grouping shark species 
together under preferred Alternative C4: 
€Atlantic sharpnose, bonnethead, and smoothhound sharks: Atlantic 
sharpnose and bonnethead sharks could 
be caught in similar areas using similar 
fishing techniques. Currently, Atlantic 
sharpnose, bonnethead, and 
smoothhound sharks are similarly 
managed in the recreational shark 
fishery (i.e., no minimum size limit) and under preferred Alternative C4, these 
species would continue to have no 
minimum size limit. Thus, these species 
are grouped together. 
€Blacknose and finetooth sharks: Blacknose and finetooth sharks have 
similar sizes at maturity. Additionally, 
they look similar and can be very 
difficult to distinguish. To avoid 
misidentification during recreational 
fishing activities, these species are 
grouped together. 
€Blacktip and spinner sharks: Blacktip and spinner sharks look similar 
and can be very difficult to distinguish. 
To avoid misidentification during 
recreational fishing activities, these 
species are grouped together. 
€Great hammerhead, scalloped hammerhead, and smooth hammerhead 
sharks: Hammerhead species have similar sizes at maturity. Additionally, 
they look very similar and 
distinguishing hammerhead sharks from 
each other is quite difficult even for the 
most seasoned fishermen. However, 
hammerhead species can be 
distinguished easily from other LCS. 
Thus, these species are grouped 
together. 
€Bull, lemon, nurse, and tiger sharks: These LCS are grouped together because 
most of them have similar sizes at 
maturity, and they could be caught in 
similar areas using similar fishing 
techniques. 
€Blue, common thresher, and porbeagle sharks: These pelagic shark 
species are grouped together because 
they have similar sizes at maturity and 
they could be caught in similar areas 
using similar fishing techniques. 
Under preferred Alternative C4, 
NMFS would set a maximum 
recreational minimum size limit equal 
to the status quo minimum size limit 
(i.e., 54 inches (137.2 cm) FL) for small coastal and smoothhound sharks. For 
other shark species, NMFS would set a 
maximum recreational minimum size 
limit that is approximately 12 inches 
(30.5 cm) FL longer than the shark 
species in that group with the longest 
female size at maturity, with the 
exception of the two larger LCS groups 
(i.e., hammerhead (great, scalloped and smooth), and bull, lemon, nurse, and 
tiger sharks) which would have the 
same maximum recreational minimum 
size limits, to simplify the measures for

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS219 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules fishermen. For example, blue, common 
thresher, and porbeagle sharks reach 
female size at maturity at 73 inches 
(185.4 cm) FL, 83 inches (210.8 cm) FL, 
and 82 inches (208.3 cm) FL, 
respectively. Of the three species in the 
group, common thresher shark has the 
longest female size at maturity (83 
inches (210.3 cm) FL). Under this 
alternative, the maximum recreational 
minimum size limit would be 95 inches 
(241.3 cm) FL, which is 12 inches (30.5 
cm) longer than the female size at 
maturity for common thresher shark. 
This would allow the recreational 
minimum size limit for a species group 
to be set equal to, above, or below the 
female sizes at maturity of the 
individual species in the group, within 
the defined minimum size limit range 
for the group. Additionally, under this 
alternative, NMFS could remove the 
recreational minimum size limit for a 
shark group under certain conditions. 
The recreational minimum size limit 
may be adjusted, or removed, to 
increase or decrease harvest rates, based 
on relevant factors, such as the landings 
and landing trends over the past 3 
calendar years, the relevant recreational 
retention limit, and other relevant 
factors (e.g., health of the stock, new scientific information, and other fishery 
conditions). 
Under preferred Alternative C4, the 
default recreational minimum size 
limits would be revised for shark groups 
where the midpoint value of the female 
sizes at maturity for the shark species in 
that group is smaller than the current 
default recreational retention limit for 
those species. Thus, under preferred 
Alternative C4, NMFS would revise the 
default recreational minimum size 
limits for the blacknose and finetooth 
shark group and the blacktip and 
spinner shark group because their 
female sizes at maturity are well below 
the current minimum size limit for these 
species (i.e., 54 inches (137 cm) FL). NMFS selected the default minimum 
size limits based on a midpoint of the 
sizes at maturity for the shark species 
grouped together. A midpoint value 
would result in a minimum size limit 
that balances differing sizes at maturity 
for grouped species while limiting the 
unintentional harvest of immature 
individuals of any species in the group. 
Under preferred Alternative C4, the 
default recreational minimum size 
limits for other recreationally 
authorized shark species would 
continue to be consistent with current 
HMS regulations (§ 635.20(e)). 
Maintaining the status quo as the 
default minimum size limit would avoid 
unnecessarily constraining the 
recreational shark fishery with higher 
minimum size limits, given that 
recreational harvest is low. See table 1 
for proposed shark groups and their 
respective recreational minimum size 
limit ranges and default minimum size 
limits under Alternative C4.

In Amendment 14, NMFS set forth a 
revised framework for establishing 
quotas that included, among other 
things, a method to actively monitor the 
recreational sector ACLs. In short, if 
recreational ACLs are established, 
NMFS could adjust the recreational 
sector ACLs annually based on data 
from the past 3 years. The most recent 
3 years of data should account for the 
high variability of recreational harvest 
and mortality, and would provide an 
updated representation of the 
recreational harvest and mortality in the 
fisheries outside of a stock assessment. 
In addition to adjusting the ACLs, as 
needed, NMFS could consider 
management measures to control 
mortality, such as adjustments to 
minimum size limits, if needed to 
account for underharvest and 
overharvest of the recreational catch. 
For example, in a situation where a 
shark species or group’s recreational 
ACL is not fully harvested based on the 
average from the previous 3 years, 
NMFS could reduce minimum size 
limits to increase fishing opportunities 
in the following year. If a shark species 
or group’s ACL is overharvested based 
on the average from the previous 3 
years, NMFS could increase size limits 
in the following year to reduce the rate 
of harvest. In other words, once NMFS 
establishes ACLs for the recreational 
shark fisheries, preferred Alternative C4 
would allow NMFS to effectively 
manage the recreational shark fishery by 
adjusting the minimum size to increase 
or decrease harvest rates based on 
updated mortality estimates consistent 
with the framework established in 
Amendment 14. 
Recreational Retention Limits 
NMFS is proposing, under preferred 
Alternative D2, to establish flexible 
recreational retention limits for shark 
species. The default recreational 
retention limits in preferred Alternative 
D2 would be consistent with current 
HMS regulations (§ 635.22(c)), with the 
exception of Atlantic sharpnose, 
bonnethead and blacktip sharks, which 
would have separate default recreational 
retention limits. NMFS would set all 
recreational retention limits based on a 
number of sharks per vessel per trip, to 
simplify regulations and reduce 
confusion regarding which species have 
vessel- or person-specific retention 
limits. Thus, NMFS would no longer 
manage Atlantic sharpnose and 
bonnethead sharks under an additional 
one-shark-per-person-per-vessel 
recreational retention limit, but under a 
shark(s) per-vessel-per-trip basis. 
Under preferred Alternative D2, 
NMFS would set maximum recreational 
retention limits for shark species as 
shown in table 2. These limits are 
generally consistent with recreational 
regulations in state waters of relevant 
states, which is where the majority of 
recreational shark catches occur. The 
recreational retention limit for a given 
species or group of species may be 
adjusted within the defined retention

species, or removed entirely, to increase 
or decrease harvest rates, based on the 
inseason trip limit adjustment criteria 
listed in § 635.24(a)(8). If a recreational 
retention limit is removed for a species, 
or group of species, per the criteria 
listed in § 635.24(a)(8), there would be 
no limit to the number of sharks of that 
species, or group of species, that could 
be retained per vessel per trip. See table 
2 for the proposed recreational retention 
limit ranges, including the default 
retention limit, for shark species under 
Alternative D2. This preferred 
alternative would be a shift from the 
status quo (Alternative D1) where the 
retention limit is fixed at one shark per 
vessel per trip for most species; one 
Atlantic sharpnose shark and one 
bonnethead shark per person per trip; 
and no retention limit for smoothhound 
sharks.

As discussed above, NMFS intends in 
the future to begin actively monitoring 
and adjusting the recreational sector 
ACLs. When doing this, as needed, 
NMFS would consider adjustments to 
recreational retention limits to control 
mortality and account for underharvests 
and overharvests of the recreational 
sector ACLs. This alternative would 
allow NMFS to adjust accountability 
measures annually based on updated 
mortality estimates from the previous 3 
years and more effectively manage the 
recreational shark fishery. Flexible 
recreational retention limits would 
allow NMFS to update the recreational 
retention limits consistent with the 
framework established in Amendment 
14. 
Other Alternatives Considered 
In addition to the proposed measures 
described above, in the EA for this 
action, NMFS analyzed four no action 
alternatives (i.e., Alternatives A1, B1, C1, and D1) that would maintain the 
status quo in the commercial and 
recreational shark fisheries. NMFS does 
not prefer the no action alternatives 
because they do not meet the objectives 
of the rulemaking. The EA for this 
action also describes the impacts of 
other alternatives. In the commercial 
shark fishery, there is one other 
alternative, to remove the blacknose 
shark commercial retention limit in the 
Atlantic region (Alternative B3). In the 
recreational shark fishery, there are four 
other alternatives regarding minimum 
size and retention limits: establish 
minimum size limits for sharks based on 
each species’ female size at maturity 
(Alternative C2); establish minimum 
size limits for shark groups based on 
grouped species’ female sizes at 
maturity (Alternative C3); remove 
minimum size limits for sharks 
(Alternative C5); and remove retention 
limits (Alternative D3). At this time, 
NMFS does not prefer any alternative 
that would remove accountability 
measures (retention limits and 
minimum size limits) in commercial 
and recreational shark fisheries and 
reduce NMFS’ ability to actively manage 
shark fisheries and ensure equitable 
fishing opportunities for all fishermen. 
Additionally, NMFS does not prefer any 
alternative that would not increase 
management flexibility and allow for 
additional opportunities to harvest 
available quota to achieve optimum 
yield, consistent with National Standard 
1 and the objective of this rulemaking. 
Additional Proposed Regulatory 
Changes 
NMFS is proposing to remove 
commercial management group quota 
linkages specified in § 635.28(b)(3) and 
(4), consistent with Amendment 14. In 
Amendment 14, NMFS approved a 
management option to remove 
commercial management group quota 
linkages to allow fisheries to remain 
open all year and ensure that each shark 
management group or species’ quota is 
fully utilized. Once an ACL is reached, 
NMFS would close that fishery to 
prevent overharvest. Amendment 14 did 
not include any implementing 
regulations; therefore, NMFS is 
proposing to remove the commercial 
management group quota linkages. 
NMFS is proposing to clarify some of 
the existing references to thresher shark 
in the regulations to specify to which 
species of thresher shark (i.e., common or bigeye) the regulations apply. 
Currently, the regulations refer to 
‘‘common thresher’’ shark and 
‘‘thresher’’ shark interchangeably as an 
authorized species in commercial and 
recreational shark fisheries and ‘‘bigeye 
thresher’’ shark as a prohibited species. 
Because there are two species of 
thresher shark (i.e., common and bigeye), the use of ‘‘thresher’’ shark in 
the regulations could cause confusion 
for fishery participants and enforcement 
regarding which species of thresher 
shark the regulations apply to. Revising 
‘‘thresher’’ shark to ‘‘common thresher’’ 
shark would create consistency with 
other references to the common thresher 
shark in HMS regulations and reduce 
the potential for confusion with the 
prohibited bigeye thresher shark. The 
regulations themselves are not changing; 
the applicable commercial and 
recreational fishery management 
measures would continue to apply to 
common thresher shark and bigeye 
thresher shark would continue to be a 
prohibited species. For example, under 
§ 635.24, the shark species previously 
referred to as ‘‘thresher’’ shark would be 
changed to ‘‘common thresher’’ shark. 
Accordingly, in table 1 of appendix A to 
part 635—Oceanic Sharks, and table 2 of 
appendix A to part 635—Pelagic 
Species, the shark species previously 
referred to as ‘‘Thresher shark, Alopias 
vulpinus’’ would be changed to 
‘‘Common thresher shark, Alopias 
vulpinus.’’ 
NMFS is also proposing to update the 
name of the management group ‘‘pelagic 
sharks other than blue or porbeagle’’ to 
‘‘common thresher and shortfin mako 
sharks’’ throughout the HMS 
regulations. This change is to clarify 
that the only shark species that can be 
harvested from this management group 
is common thresher shark and, when

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS221 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules authorized, shortfin mako shark. This 
revision does not change the species 
within this management group (i.e., 
common thresher and shortfin mako 
sharks) or within the pelagic shark 
complex. 
NMFS is proposing to remove several 
references to oceanic whitetip sharks in 
commercial fishery regulations in 
§§ 635.21(c)(1)(ii), 635.31(c)(6), and 
635.71(d)(19). On January 3, 2024, 
NMFS published a final rule (89 FR 278) 
that prohibited the retention and 
possession of oceanic whitetip sharks in 
commercial and recreational fisheries in 
Federal waters of the Atlantic Ocean, 
including the Gulf of America and 
Caribbean Sea, effective February 2, 
2024. In that rulemaking, NMFS 
inadvertently left several references to 
oceanic whitetip sharks in the 
commercial fishery regulations. 
Removing the references to oceanic 
whitetip sharks in commercial fisheries 
would further clarify the intent of the 
final rule that prohibited the retention 
and possession of oceanic whitetip 
sharks in all HMS fisheries. 
NMFS is also proposing several 
technical changes. In § 635.20(e)(6) 
(redesignated to paragraph (e)(8) in this 
action), NMFS would revise ‘‘fork 
length’’ to ‘‘FL’’ for consistency with the 
defined acronym and use of ‘‘FL’’ for 
‘‘fork length’’ in HMS regulations. In 
§ 635.28(b)(1)(iii) and (v), NMFS would 
revise the references to publication of a 
notice in the Federal Register to a more 
general reference of publication in the 
Federal Register for consistency with 
other references in HMS regulations. 
Section 635.28(b)(5) (which would be 
redesignated as paragraph (b)(4) by this 
proposed action) would also be revised 
for grammatical improvement and to 
update a Code of Federal Regulations 
reference to the paragraph level. These 
clarifications would improve the 
administration of HMS regulations and 
are consistent with previously analyzed 
and approved management measures. 
Request for Comments 
NMFS is requesting comments on this 
proposed rule, which may be submitted 
via https://www.regulations.gov or at a public hearing. NMFS solicits 
comments on this action by March 6, 
2026 (see 
DATESand ADDRESSES 
sections). 
During the comment period, NMFS 
will hold two public hearings via 
webinar for this proposed action, as 
shown in table 3. Requests for sign 
language interpretation or other 
auxiliary aids should be directed to Ann 
Williamson at ann.williamson@
noaa.gov or 301–427–8503, at least 7 days prior to the meeting. In addition, 
any requests for in-person public

interrupt one another). At the beginning 
of each webinar, the moderator will 
explain how the webinar will be 
conducted and how and when 
participants can provide comments. The 
NMFS representative(s) will attempt to 
structure the webinar so that all 
attending members of the public will be 
able to comment, if they so choose, 
regardless of the controversial nature of 
the subject(s). Attendees are expected to 
respect the ground rules, and if they do 
not, they may not be allowed to speak 
during the webinar. 
Classification 
The NMFS Assistant Administrator 
has determined that this proposed rule 
is consistent with the HMS FMP and its 
amendments, other provisions of the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, ATCA, and 
other applicable law, subject to further 
consideration after public comment. 
This proposed rule has been 
determined to be not significant for 
purposes of E.O. 12866. 
This final rule is not an E.O. 14192 
regulatory action because this action is 
not significant under E.O. 12866. 
An IRFA was prepared, as required by 
section 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The 
IRFA describes the economic impact 
that this proposed rule, if adopted, 
would have on small entities. A 
description of the action, why it is being 
considered, and the legal basis for this 
action are contained at the beginning of 
this section in the preamble and in the 
SUMMARYsection of the preamble. A 
summary of the analysis follows. A copy 
of this analysis is available from NMFS 
(see 
ADDRESSESsection). 
Section 603(b)(1) requires agencies to 
describe the reasons why the action is 
being considered. The purpose of this 
proposed rulemaking is to increase 
management flexibility to react to 
additional factors impacting Atlantic 
shark fisheries and optimize the ability 
of the commercial and recreational 
shark fisheries to harvest available quota 
to the extent practicable, consistent with 
the objectives of the HMS FMP and its 
amendments, the Magnuson-Stevens 
Act, and other applicable laws. 
Implementation of the proposed rule 
would further the management goals 
and objectives stated in the HMS FMP 
and its amendments. 
Section 603(b)(2) of the RFA requires 
agencies to state the objectives of, and 
legal basis for, the proposed action. The 
objective of this proposed rulemaking is 
to be responsive to the framework for 
implementing management measures 
established in Amendment 14, findings 
from the SHARE document, public 
comments from scoping for Amendment 
16, and recent domestic laws and 
international agreements that are having 
direct and indirect impacts on the 
commercial fishery. The legal basis for 
the proposed rule is the Magnuson- 
Stevens Act. 
Section 603(b)(3) of the RFA requires 
agencies to provide an estimate of the 
number of small entities to which the 
proposed rule would apply. For RFA 
compliance purposes, NMFS 
established a small business size 
standard of $11 million in annual gross 
receipts for all businesses in the 
commercial fishing industry (North 
American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) 11411). The Small 
Business Administration (SBA) has 
established size standards for all other 
major industry sectors in the United 
States, including the scenic and 
sightseeing transportation (water) sector 
(NAICS code 487210), which includes 
for-hire (charter/party boat) fishing

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS222 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules entities. The SBA has defined a small 
entity under the scenic and sightseeing 
transportation (water) sector as one with 
average annual receipts (i.e., revenue) of less than $14 million. Therefore, NMFS 
considers all HMS permit holders, both 
commercial and for-hire, to be small 
entities because they had average 
annual receipts of less than their 
respective sector’s standard of $11 
million and $14 million. The 2022 total 
ex-vessel annual revenue for the shark 
fishery was approximately $2.2 million. 
Since a small business is defined as 
having annual receipts not in excess of 
$11 million, each individual shark 
fishing entity would fall within the 
small business definition. Thus, all of 
the entities affected by this rulemaking 
are considered to be small entities for 
the purposes of the RFA. 
As of October 2023, there were 188 
Shark Directed permits and 221 Shark 
Incidental permits. As of December 
2023, there were 4,324 HMS Charter/ 
Headboat permits (with 3,085 shark 
endorsements and 2,014 commercial 
sale endorsements), 24,552 HMS 
Angling permits (with 12,840 shark 
endorsements), and 3,471 Atlantic 
Tunas General and Swordfish General 
Commercial permits (with 1,709 shark 
endorsements). For more information 
regarding the distribution of these 
permits across states and territories 
please see the HMS Stock Assessment 
and Fishery Evaluation Report. 
Section 603(b)(4) of the RFA requires 
agencies to describe any new reporting, 
record-keeping, and other compliance 
requirements. This proposed rule does 
not contain any new collection of 
information, reporting, or record- 
keeping requirements. This proposed 
rule would remove the blacknose shark 
management boundary in the Atlantic 
region, modify the commercial retention 
limit for blacknose sharks in the 
Atlantic region, revise the recreational 
minimum size limits for Atlantic shark 
species, and revise the recreational 
retention limits for Atlantic shark 
species. 
Under section 603(b)(5) of the RFA, 
agencies must identify, to the extent 
practicable, relevant Federal rules 
which duplicate, overlap, or conflict 
with the proposed action. Fishermen, 
dealers, and managers in these fisheries 
must comply with a number of 
international agreements, domestic 
laws, and other fishery management 
measures. These include, but are not 
limited to, the Magnuson-Stevens Act, 
ATCA, the High Seas Fishing 
Compliance Act, the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act, the Endangered Species 
Act, the National Environmental Policy 
Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and 
the Coastal Zone Management Act. This 
proposed action has been determined 
not to duplicate, overlap, or conflict 
with any Federal rules. 
Under section 603(c) of the RFA, 
agencies must describe any significant 
alternatives to the proposed rule which 
accomplish the stated objectives of 
applicable statutes and which minimize 
any significant economic impact of the 
proposed rule on small entities. 
Specifically, section 603(c)(1)–(4) of the 
RFA lists four general categories of 
significant alternatives to assist an 
agency in the development of significant 
alternatives. These categories of 
alternatives are (1) establishment of 
differing compliance or reporting 
requirements or timetables that take into 
account the resources available to small 
entities; (2) clarification, consolidation, 
or simplification of compliance and 
reporting requirements under the rule 
for such small entities; (3) use of 
performance rather than design 
standards; and, (4) exemptions from 
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, 
for small entities. 
Regarding the first, second, and fourth 
categories, all of the businesses 
impacted by this proposed rule are 
considered small entities, and thus the 
requirements are already designed for 
small entities. Regarding the third 
category, NMFS does not know of any 
performance or design standards that 
would satisfy the aforementioned 
objectives of this rulemaking. As 
described below, NMFS analyzed 
several different alternatives in this 
proposed rulemaking and provides 
rationales for identifying the preferred 
alternatives to achieve the desired 
objectives. 
The alternatives considered and 
analyzed are described below. The IRFA 
assumes that each vessel will have 
similar catch and gross revenues to 
show the relative impact of the 
proposed action on vessels. 
Under Alternative A1, the No Action 
alternative, NMFS would continue 
management based on the current 
blacknose shark management boundary 
in the Atlantic region. Currently, 
blacknose sharks may be commercially 
harvested only south of lat. 34°00 N by vessels issued a Directed or Incidental 
shark LAP. Vessels issued a Directed or 
Incidental shark LAP would not be 
allowed to retain blacknose sharks north 
of lat. 34°00 N. Thus, Alternative A1 would not result in any additional 
economic impact for HMS permit 
holders, and would have neutral 
economic impacts on the small entities 
participating in this fishery. 
Under Alternative A2 (preferred), 
NMFS would remove the blacknose 
shark management boundary and allow 
blacknose sharks to be commercially 
harvested in the entire Atlantic region 
by vessels issued a Directed or 
Incidental shark LAP. This alternative 
would expand fishing opportunities for 
commercial vessels issued a Directed or 
Incidental Shark LAP, including those 
that operate north and south of lat. 
34°00 N, as they would be able to fish for and retain blacknose sharks caught 
anywhere in the Atlantic region. This is 
particularly significant, given that the 
commercial quota is under harvested 
(from 2017 through 2022, on average 
only 36.3 percent of the quota was 
utilized), and the stock’s range is 
expanding further northward along the 
Atlantic coast. Thus, Alternative A2 
would have minor beneficial economic 
impacts on the small entities 
participating in the fishery, as they 
would further optimize the commercial 
fishery’s ability to fully utilize the 
available quota and earn additional 
income from the sale of blacknose 
sharks. 
Under Alternative B1, the No Action 
alternative, NMFS would maintain the 
current commercial retention limit of 
eight blacknose sharks per vessel per 
trip for vessels issued a Directed shark 
LAP in the Atlantic region. Alternative 
B1 would not result in any change in 
fishing effort, and would have neutral 
economic impacts on the small entities 
participating in the fishery. 
Under Alternative B2 (preferred), 
NMFS would establish a flexible 
commercial retention limit of 0 to 60 
blacknose sharks per vessel per trip for 
vessels issued a Directed shark LAP in 
the Atlantic region. The default 
commercial retention limit that would 
apply at the start of each fishing year 
would be 25 blacknose sharks per vessel 
per trip. The commercial retention limit 
could be adjusted during the fishing 
year based on the inseason trip limit 
adjustment criteria at § 635.24(a)(8). 
Under this alternative, the potential 
gross revenue for each vessel that has 
landed the default retention limit for 
blacknose sharks would be 
approximately $402 per vessel per trip, 
with gross revenue per trip from 
blacknose sharks ranging from 
approximately $0 to $964 under the 0- 
to-60 blacknose shark commercial 
retention limit, respectively (see table 
4.5 in the EA). A higher default 
commercial retention limit for 
blacknose sharks would provide new 
economic benefits to Directed shark 
LAP holders. While revenue could 
increase on a per-trip basis, the total 
potential revenue per year available to 
the entire fleet would not change 
because the blacknose shark commercial

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS223 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules quota would not change. Thus, 
preferred Alternative B2 would likely 
result in neutral to minor beneficial 
economic impacts on the small entities 
participating in this fishery since the 
default commercial retention limit is set 
above the status quo commercial 
retention limit, which would result in 
Directed shark LAP holders realizing 
higher trip revenues by selling more 
blacknose sharks per trip. The impacts 
could be minor adverse if the 
commercial quota is harvested and the 
fishery closes early in the year. 
However, an early fishery closure is 
unlikely because NMFS would actively 
monitor the quota and if catch rates are 
high, NMFS could reduce the retention 
limit to extend the commercial fishery. 
Under Alternative B3, NMFS would 
remove the commercial retention limit 
for blacknose sharks in the Atlantic 
region. For commercial vessels issued a 
Directed shark LAP, there would be no 
trip limit for blacknose sharks, as long 
as catch rates remain within the 
available blacknose shark quota. Based 
on average ex-vessel prices from 2017 
through 2022 ($1.41 per pound dressed 
weight), the commercial fleet earned an 
average of $19,394 in revenue per year 
from blacknose sharks. During the same 
time, on average only 36.3 percent of the 
quota was harvested by an average of 17 
active vessels (78 percent of the 
landings were from five vessels). Fully 
harvesting the blacknose shark 
commercial quota could result in an 
estimated annual total fleet revenue of 
approximately $53,532 and an 
individual vessel revenue of 
approximately $3,149 (across the fleet) 
or approximately $10,706 (for the top 
five vessels). However, the opportunity 
to retain blacknose sharks without a 
retention limit could lead to a faster 
harvest of the available commercial 
quota and an early fishery closure. This 
may create a sense of urgency for 
Directed shark LAP holders to harvest 
the quota as quickly as possible. 
Furthermore, removing the commercial 
retention limit would eliminate an 
accountability measure for ensuring 
equitable fishing opportunities for all 
Directed shark LAP holders. Thus, 
Alternative B3 would likely result in 
minor adverse economic impacts on the 
small entities participating in this 
fishery because the absence of a 
commercial retention limit could result 
in reaching and/or exceeding the 
commercial quota earlier in the fishing 
year and necessitate early fishery 
closure, which could limit opportunities 
to earn revenue from blacknose sharks 
year round. 
The recreational minimum size and 
retention limit alternatives considered 
in this proposed rule apply to HMS 
Angling and HMS Charter/Headboat 
permit holders, and Atlantic Tunas 
General category and Swordfish General 
Commercial permit holders when 
participating in a registered HMS 
tournament. HMS Angling permit 
holders are not considered to be small 
entities under RFA. Small entity 
impacts from recreational minimum size 
and retention limit alternatives would 
primarily be associated with HMS 
Charter/Headboat permit holders, and to 
a less extent, the occasional 
participation of Atlantic Tunas General 
category and Swordfish General 
Commercial permit holders in registered 
HMS tournaments. 
Under Alternative C1, the No Action 
alternative, NMFS would maintain the 
current recreational minimum size 
limits for sharks, as follows: all sharks, 
unless otherwise specified, must be at 
least 54 inches (137 cm) FL; all 
hammerhead sharks must be at least 78 
inches (198.1 cm) FL; and there is no 
size limit for Atlantic sharpnose, 
bonnethead, or smoothhound sharks. 
Alternative C1 would not result in any 
change in fishing effort, and would have 
neutral economic impacts on the small 
entities, primarily HMS Charter/ 
Headboat permit holders, participating 
in the fishery. 
Under Alternative C2, NMFS would 
establish recreational minimum size 
limits that are specific to the female size 
at maturity for each species. While this 
alternative would increase opportunities 
to harvest shark species that mature at 
lengths shorter than the current 
recreational minimum size limit, there 
would be decreased opportunities to 
harvest shark species that mature at 
lengths longer than the current 
minimum size limit. Additionally, 
charter crew would need to keep track 
of a large number of minimum size 
limits and identify each shark to the 
species level. If a prohibited or 
undersized shark is retained due to 
misidentification or other reasons, a 
civil penalty could be assessed. Thus, 
Alternative C2 could have minor 
adverse economic impacts on the small 
entities participating in the fishery. 
Under Alternative C3, NMFS would 
group certain shark species together and 
set a recreational minimum size limit 
for each group, based on a midpoint 
value for the female sizes at maturity for 
the shark species in that group. Similar 
to Alternative C2, this alternative would 
increase opportunities to harvest shark 
species that mature at lengths shorter 
than the current recreational minimum 
size limit, and reduce opportunities to 
harvest shark species that mature at 
lengths longer than the current 
minimum size limit. Also similar to 
Alternative C2, this alternative would 
require charter crew to track a larger 
number of minimum size limits 
compared to the status quo and to 
identify sharks at the species level, 
which could result in increased 
unintentional illegal harvest of 
undersized individuals due to 
misidentification. However, by grouping 
species together, this alternative would 
simplify management compared to 
Alternative C2 while reducing the 
harvest of immature or misidentified 
sharks. Thus, Alternative C3 would 
have neutral economic impacts on the 
small entities participating in the 
fishery. 
Under Alternative C4 (preferred), 
NMFS would group certain shark 
species together and establish flexible 
recreational minimum size limits for 
each group. Default recreational 
minimum size limits would be based on 
a midpoint value of the female sizes at 
maturity for the shark species in that 
group, or be consistent with current 
HMS regulations. Specifically, NMFS 
would revise the default recreational 
minimum size limits for shark groups 
where the midpoint value of the female 
sizes at maturity for the shark species in 
that group is smaller than the current 
default recreational retention limit for 
those species. This alternative would 
increase opportunities to harvest shark 
species that mature at lengths shorter 
than the current recreational minimum 
size limit, and if minimum size limits 
are reduced below the default, further 
opportunities for harvest may be 
realized. However, if minimum size 
limits are increased above the default, 
there would be decreased opportunities 
to harvest those shark species. Thus, 
Alternative C4 would have neutral to 
minor beneficial economic impacts on 
the small entities participating in the 
fishery. 
Under Alternative C5, NMFS would 
remove recreational minimum size 
limits for shark species and thus allow 
the retention of recreationally 
authorized shark species of any size. 
While the absence of recreational 
minimum size limits would increase 
opportunities for shark harvest, high 
rates of harvest would risk a fishery 
closure. However, given the catch-and- 
release nature of the recreational shark 
fishery, substantial increases in shark 
harvest rates are unlikely. Additionally, 
removing recreational minimum size 
limits would eliminate an 
accountability measure to control 
harvest levels, and a management tool to 
aid in rebuilding some shark species by 
allowing sharks to be harvested before 
they reach maturity, which could

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS224 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules impact fishing opportunities in the 
future. Thus, Alternative C5 would have 
minor adverse to neutral economic 
impacts on the small entities 
participating in the fishery. 
Under Alternative D1, the No Action 
alternative, NMFS would maintain the 
current recreational retention limits. 
The current recreational retention limit 
allows one shark from the following list 
per vessel per trip: Atlantic blacktip, 
Gulf of America blacktip, bull, great 
hammerhead, scalloped hammerhead, 
smooth hammerhead, lemon, nurse, 
spinner, tiger, blue, common thresher, 
porbeagle, Atlantic sharpnose, finetooth, 
Atlantic blacknose, Gulf of America 
blacknose, and bonnethead. 
Additionally, there is a recreational 
retention limit of one shark per person 
per trip for Atlantic sharpnose and 
bonnethead. There is no recreational 
retention limit for smoothhound sharks. 
Alternative D1 would not result in any 
change in fishing effort, and would have 
neutral economic impacts on the small 
entities participating in the fishery. 
Under Alternative D2 (preferred), 
NMFS would establish flexible 
recreational retention limits for sharks. 
Default recreational retention limits 
would be consistent with current HMS 
regulations, except for Atlantic 
sharpnose, bonnethead, and blacktip 
sharks, which will have separate default 
recreational retention limits on a per- 
vessel-per-trip basis. This alternative 
would increase opportunities to harvest 
sharks, particularly those species that 
would have separate recreational 
retention limits (e.g., blacktip sharks). These opportunities would be further 
expanded if the recreational retention 
limits are increased above the default 
limits; conversely, opportunities could 
be decreased if the retention limits are 
lowered below the default limits. 
Additionally, higher recreational 
retention limits would increase 
opportunities for HMS Charter/ 
Headboat permit holders to offer more 
attractive offshore shark trips 
(particularly for pelagic sharks) given 
the potentially higher retention limits, 
and thus potentially earn more revenue 
from higher priced charters and/or 
greater demand for charter trips. Thus, 
Alternative D2 would likely result in 
minor beneficial economic impacts on 
the small entities providing for-hire 
fishing trips in the fishery. 
Under Alternative D3, NMFS would 
remove recreational retention limits for 
sharks, allowing the retention of an 
unlimited number of sharks on a per- 
trip basis. This alternative would 
increase opportunities to harvest sharks. 
Additionally, the absence of recreational 
retention limits would increase 
opportunities for HMS Charter/ 
Headboat permit holders to offer more 
attractive offshore shark trips 
(particularly for pelagic sharks) without 
retention limits, and thus potentially 
earn more revenue from higher priced 
charters and/or greater demand for 
charter trips. Increased opportunities to 
potentially increase for-hire revenue 
would potentially be offset by a fishery 
closure if harvest levels exceed the 
available quotas. However, without 
recreational retention limits, NMFS 
would be unable to control harvest 
levels in the recreational shark fishery 
and high catch rates could lead to 
fishery closures. Closures in the 
recreational shark fishery could have 
negative economic impacts, particular 
for HMS Charter/Headboat permit 
holders. Thus, Alternative D3 would 
have neutral to minor adverse economic 
impacts on the small entities 
participating in the fishery. 
This proposed rule contains no 
information collection requirements 
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995.

Samuel D. Rauch III, 
Deputy Assistant Administrator for 
Regulatory Programs, National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
For the reasons set out in the 
preamble, NMFS proposes to amend 50 
CFR part 635 as follows: 
PART 635—ATLANTIC HIGHLY 
MIGRATORY SPECIES 
1. The authority citation for part 635 
continues to read as follows: 
Authority: 16 U.S.C. 971 et seq.; 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. 2. In § 635.2, revise the definition of 
‘‘management group’’ to read as follows: 
§ 635.2 Definitions. 
* * * * * 
Management group in regard to sharks 
means a group of shark species that are 
combined for quota management 
purposes. A management group may be 
split by region or sub-region, as defined 
at § 635.27(b)(1). A fishery for a 
management group can be opened or 
closed as a whole or at the regional or 
sub-regional levels. Sharks have the 
following management groups: Atlantic 
aggregated LCS, Gulf of America 
aggregated LCS, research LCS, 
hammerhead, Atlantic non-blacknose 
SCS, Gulf of America non-blacknose 
SCS, and common thresher and shortfin 
mako sharks. 
* * * * * 
3. In § 635.20, revise paragraph (e) to 
read as follows: 
§ 635.20 Size limits. 
* * * * * 
(e) Sharks. All size limits in this paragraph (e) and listed in table 1 to 
paragraph (e) are recreational minimum 
size limits. No person on a vessel that 
has been issued, or should have been 
issued, a permit with a shark 
endorsement under § 635.4 shall take, 
possess, or retain a shark that is less 
than the relevant minimum size limit. 
At the start of each fishing year and 
consistent with the retention limits 
specified at § 635.22(c), the default 
minimum size limits will apply. During 
the fishing year, NMFS may adjust 
minimum size limits within the range 
specified in table 1 to paragraph (e) 
based upon a review of the landings and 
landing trends over the past 3 calendar 
years, the relevant retention limit 
specified at § 635.22(c), and any other 
relevant factors. NMFS will announce 
any adjustments to minimum size limits 
by publication in the Federal Register. 
The adjusted minimum size limit(s) will 
remain in effect through the end of the 
fishing year or until otherwise adjusted.

relevant retention limit, except as noted 
in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. At the 
start of each fishing year and consistent 
with the minimum size limits specified 
at § 635.20(e), the default recreational

year, NMFS may adjust retention limits 
within the range specified in table 1 to 
Paragraph (c) based upon the inseason

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with PROPOSALS226 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Proposed Rules (i) Except as provided in 
§ 635.22(c)(3), a person who owns or 
operates a vessel that has been issued a 
directed shark LAP may retain, possess, 
land, or sell pelagic sharks if the pelagic 
shark fishery is open per §§ 635.27 and 
635.28. Shortfin mako sharks may be 
retained by persons aboard vessels using 
pelagic longline, bottom longline, or 
gillnet gear only if NMFS has adjusted 
the commercial retention limit above 
zero pursuant to paragraph (a)(4)(v) of 
this section and only if the shark is dead 
at the time of haulback and consistent 
with the provisions of §§ 635.21(c)(1), 
(d)(5), and (f)(6) and 635.22(c)(3). 
(ii) A person who owns or operates a 
vessel that has been issued a shark LAP 
and is operating in the Atlantic region, 
as defined at § 635.27(b)(1), may retain, 
possess, land, or sell blacknose and non- 
blacknose SCS if the respective 
blacknose and non-blacknose SCS 
management groups are open per 
§§ 635.27 and 635.28. At the start of 
each fishing year, such persons may 
retain, possess, land, or sell no more 
than 25 blacknose sharks per vessel per 
trip. During the fishing year, NMFS may 
adjust the commercial retention limit for 
blacknose sharks to a limit between 0 
and 60 sharks per vessel per trip, per the 
inseason trip limit adjustment criteria 
listed in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. 
A person who owns or operates a vessel 
that has been issued a shark LAP and is 
operating in the Gulf of America region, 
as defined at § 635.27(b)(1), may not 
retain, possess, land, or sell any 
blacknose sharks, but may retain, 
possess, land, or sell non-blacknose SCS 
if the respective non-blacknose SCS 
management group is open per 
§§ 635.27 and 635.28. 
(iii) Consistent with paragraph 
(a)(4)(ii) of this section, a person who 
owns or operates a vessel that has been 
issued an incidental shark LAP may 
retain, possess, land, or sell no more 
than 16 SCS and pelagic sharks, 
combined, per vessel per trip, if the 
respective fishery is open per §§ 635.27 
and 635.28. Of those 16 SCS and pelagic 
sharks per vessel per trip, no more than 
8 shall be blacknose sharks. Shortfin 
mako sharks may be retained only under 
the commercial retention limits by 
persons using pelagic longline, bottom 
longline, or gillnet gear only if NMFS 
has adjusted the commercial retention 
limit above zero pursuant to paragraph 
(a)(4)(v) of this section and only if the 
shark is dead at the time of haulback 
and consistent with the provisions at 
§ 635.21(c)(1), (d)(5), and (f)(6). If the 
vessel has also been issued a permit 
with a shark endorsement and retains a 
shortfin mako shark, recreational 
retention limits apply to all sharks 
retained and none may be sold, per 
§ 635.22(c)(3). 
(iv) A person who owns, operates, or 
is aboard a vessel that has been issued 
an HMS Commercial Caribbean Small 
Boat permit may retain, possess, land, or 
sell any blacktip, bull, lemon, nurse, 
spinner, tiger, Atlantic sharpnose, 
bonnethead, finetooth, and

who owns, operates, or is aboard a 
vessel that has been issued an HMS 
Commercial Caribbean Small Boat 
permit may not retain, possess, land, or 
sell any hammerhead, blacknose, silky, 
sandbar, blue, common thresher, 
shortfin mako, or prohibited shark, 
including parts or pieces of these 
sharks. The shark retention limit for a 
person who owns, operates, or is aboard 
a vessel issued an HMS Commercial 
Caribbean Small Boat permit will range 
from zero to three sharks per vessel per 
trip. At the start of each fishing year, the 
default shark trip limit will apply. 
During the fishing year, NMFS may 
adjust the default shark trip limit per 
the inseason trip limit adjustment 
criteria listed in paragraph (a)(8) of this 
section. The default shark retention 
limit for the HMS Commercial 
Caribbean Small Boat permit is three 
sharks per vessel per trip.

Final Results and Final Determination 
of No Shipments of Antidumping Duty 
Administrative Review; 2023–2024 
AGENCY: Enforcement and Compliance, International Trade Administration, 
Department of Commerce. 
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) determines that 
C&U Group Shanghai Bearing Co., Ltd. 
(C&U Shanghai) did not qualify for a 
separate rate, and therefore, is 
considered part of the People’s Republic 
of China (China)-wide entity. 
Additionally, Commerce determines 
that Shanghai Tainai Bearing Co., Ltd. 
(Tainai) had no shipments of subject 
merchandise during the period of 
review (POR), June 1, 2023, through 
May 31, 2024.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
On June 20, 2025, Commerce 
published in the Federal Register the 
preliminary results of this 
administrative review of the 
antidumping duty order on tapered 
roller bearings and parts thereof, 
finished and unfinished (TRBs) from 
China.
1
This review covers two 
companies: C&U Shanghai, 
preliminarily determined to be part of 
the China-wide entity and, Tainai, 
preliminarily determined to have no 
shipments of subject merchandise 
during the POR.
2
We invited parties to 
comment on the Preliminary Results.
3
 
No interested party submitted 
comments. Accordingly, the final results 
are unchanged from the Preliminary 
Results, and no decision memorandum accompanies this Federal Register 
notice. Commerce conducted this 
administrative review in accordance 
with section 751(a) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (the Act). 
Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.
4
Additionally, 
due to a backlog of documents that were 
electronically filed via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS) 
during the Federal Government 
shutdown, on November 24, 2025, 
Commerce tolled all deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by an 
additional 21 days.
5
Accordingly, the 
deadline for these final results is now 
December 29, 2025.
6
 
Scope of the Order
7
 
The merchandise subject to the Order 
is TRBs from China. For a full 
description of the scope of the Order, 
see the Preliminary Results.8
 
Final Determination of No Shipments 
In the Preliminary Results, Commerce 
found that Tainai had no shipments of 
TRBs during the POR, based on Tainai’s

timely submitted no-shipment 
certification. As we have not received 
any information to contradict this 
preliminary finding, Commerce 
determines that Tanai did not have any 
shipments of subject merchandise 
during the POR and will issue 
appropriate instructions that are 
consistent with our ‘‘automatic 
assessment’’ clarification, for these final 
results. 
Disclosure 
Based on the above information, 
Commerce has not calculated any 
dumping margins for any companies 
under review, nor has Commerce 
granted a separate rate to any companies 
under review. Commerce continues to 
find that C&U Shanghai is part of the 
China-wide entity and is subject to the 
China-wide entity rate. Because no party 
requested a review of the China-wide 
entity, and we did not self-initiate a 
review, the China-wide entity rate
9
is 
not subject to change as a result of this 
review. Consequently, there are no 
calculations to disclose in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.224(b) for these final 
results. 
Assessment Rates 
Pursuant to section 751(a)(2)(C) of the 
Act and 19 CFR 351.212(b)(1), 
Commerce has determined, and U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
shall assess, antidumping duties on all 
appropriate entries of subject 
merchandise covered by this review. 
Commerce intends to issue assessment 
instructions to CBP no earlier than 35 
days after the date of publication of the 
final results of this review in the 
Federal Register. If a timely summons is 
filed at the U.S. Court of International 
Trade, the assessment instructions will 
direct CBP not to liquidate relevant 
entries until the time for parties to file 
a request for a statutory injunction has 
expired (i.e., within 90 days of publication). 
We have not calculated any 
assessment rates in this administrative 
review. As Commerce continues to find 
that Tainai did not have any shipments 
of subject merchandise during the POR 
and C&U Shanghai is part of the China- 
wide entity, we will instruct CBP to 
assess any suspended entries of subject 
merchandise associated with Tainai and 
C&U Shanghai at the China-wide rate 
(i.e., 92.84 percent). Cash Deposit Requirements 
The following cash deposit 
requirements will be effective upon 
publication of the final results of this 
administrative review for shipments of 
the subject merchandise from China 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after the 
publication date, as provided by section 
751(a)(2)(C) of the Act: (1) for previously 
investigated or reviewed China and non- 
China exporters that are not under 
review in this segment of the proceeding 
but have separate rates, the cash deposit 
rate will continue to be the exporter’s 
existing cash deposit rate; (2) for all 
China exporters of subject merchandise 
that have not been found to be entitled 
to a separate rate, the cash deposit rate 
will be the existing rate for the China- 
wide entity of 92.84 percent; and (3) for 
all non-China exporters of subject 
merchandise which have not received 
their own rate, the cash deposit rate will 
be the rate applicable to the China 
exporter that supplied that non-China 
exporter. These deposit requirements, 
when imposed, shall remain in effect 
until further notice. 
Notification to Importers 
This notice serves as a final reminder 
to importers of their responsibility 
under 19 CFR 351.402(f)(2) to file a 
certificate regarding the reimbursement 
of antidumping duties prior to 
liquidation of the relevant entries 
during this review period. Failure to 
comply with this requirement could 
result in Commerce’s presumption that 
reimbursement of antidumping duties 
has occurred and the subsequent 
assessment of double antidumping 
duties. 
Administrative Protective Order (APO) 
This notice also serves as a final 
reminder to parties subject to an APO of 
their responsibility concerning the 
return or destruction of proprietary 
information disclosed under APO in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.305, which 
continues to govern business 
proprietary information in this segment 
of the proceeding. Timely written 
notification of the return or destruction 
of APO materials, or conversion to 
judicial protective order, is hereby 
requested. Failure to comply with the 
regulations and terms of an APO is a 
violation which is subject to sanction. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
These final results are issued and 
published in accordance with sections 
751(a)(1)(B) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, and 
19 CFR 351.221(b)(5).

SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce) has received 
requests to conduct administrative 
reviews of various antidumping duty 
(AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) 
orders with October anniversary dates. 
In accordance with Commerce’s

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
Commerce has received timely 
requests, in accordance with 19 CFR 
351.213(b), for administrative reviews of 
various AD and CVD orders with 
October anniversary dates. All deadlines 
for the submission of various types of 
information, certifications, comments, 
or actions by Commerce discussed 
below refer to the number of calendar 
days from the applicable starting time. 
Respondent Selection 
In the event that Commerce limits the 
number of respondents for individual 
examination for administrative reviews 
initiated pursuant to requests made for 
the orders identified below, Commerce 
intends to select respondents based 
either on U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) data for U.S. imports 
during the period of review (POR) or 
questionnaires in which we request the 
quantity and value (Q&V) of sales, 
shipments, or exports during the POR. 
Where Commerce selects respondents 
based on CBP data, we intend to place 
the CBP data on the record within five

days of publication of the initiation 
notice. Where Commerce selects 
respondents based on Q&V data, 
Commerce intends to place the Q&V 
questionnaire on the record of the 
review within five days of publication 
of the initiation notice. In either case, 
we intend to make our respondent 
selection decision within 35 days of the 
Federal Register publication of the 
initiation notice. Comments regarding 
the CBP data (and/or Q&V data (where 
applicable)) and respondent selection 
should be submitted within seven days 
after the placement of the CBP data/ 
submission of the Q&V data on the 
record of the review. Parties wishing to 
submit rebuttal comments should 
submit those comments within five days 
after the deadline for the initial 
comments. 
In the event that Commerce decides it 
is necessary to limit individual 
examination of respondents and 
conduct respondent selection under 
section 777A(c)(2) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, as amended (the Act), the 
following guidelines regarding 
collapsing of companies for purposes of 
respondent selection will apply. In 
general, Commerce has found that 
determinations concerning whether 
particular companies should be 
‘‘collapsed’’ (e.g., treated as a single entity for purposes of calculating AD 
rates) require a substantial amount of 
detailed information and analysis, 
which often require follow-up questions 
and analysis. Accordingly, Commerce 
will not conduct collapsing analyses at 
the respondent selection phase of the 
review and will not collapse companies 
at the respondent selection phase unless 
there has been a determination to 
collapse certain companies in a 
previous segment of the AD proceeding 
(e.g., investigation, administrative review, new shipper review, or changed 
circumstances review). For any 
company subject to the review, if 
Commerce determined, or continued to 
treat, that company as collapsed with 
others, Commerce will assume that such 
companies continue to operate in the 
same manner and will collapse them for 
respondent selection purposes. 
Otherwise, Commerce will not collapse 
companies for purposes of respondent 
selection. 
Parties are requested to: (a) identify 
which companies subject to review 
previously were collapsed, and (b) 
provide a citation to the proceeding in 
which they were collapsed. Further, if 
companies are requested to complete 
the Q&V questionnaire for purposes of 
respondent selection, in general, each 
company must report volume and value 
data separately for itself. Parties should 
not include data for any other party, 
even if they believe they should be 
treated as a single entity with that other 
party. If a company was collapsed with 
another company or companies in the 
most recently completed segment of the 
proceeding where Commerce 
considered collapsing that entity, 
complete Q&V data for that collapsed 
entity must be submitted. 
Notice of No Sales 
With respect to AD administrative 
reviews, we intend to rescind the review 
where there are no suspended entries 
for a company or entity under review 
and/or where there are no suspended 
entries under the company-specific case 
number for that company or entity. 
Where there may be suspended entries, 
if a producer or exporter named in this 
notice of initiation had no exports, 
sales, or entries during the POR, it may 
notify Commerce of this fact within 30 
days of publication of this initiation 
notice in the Federal Register for 
Commerce to consider how to treat 
suspended entries under that producer’s 
or exporter’s company-specific case 
number. 
Deadline for Withdrawal of Request for 
Administrative Review 
Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.213(d)(1), a 
party that has requested a review may 
withdraw that request within 90 days of 
the date of publication of the notice of 
initiation of the requested review. The 
regulation provides that Commerce may 
extend this time if it is reasonable to do 
so. Determinations by Commerce to 
extend the 90-day deadline will be 
made on a case-by-case basis. 
Deadline for Particular Market 
Situation Allegation 
Section 504 of the Trade Preferences 
Extension Act of 2015 amended the Act 
by adding the concept of a particular 
market situation (PMS) for purposes of 
constructed value under section 773(e) 
of the Act.
1
Section 773(e) of the Act 
states that ‘‘if a particular market 
situation exists such that the cost of 
materials and fabrication or other 
processing of any kind does not 
accurately reflect the cost of production 
in the ordinary course of trade, the 
administering authority may use 
another calculation methodology under 
this subtitle or any other calculation 
methodology.’’ When an interested 
party submits a PMS allegation pursuant 
to section 773(e) of the Act, Commerce 
will respond to such a submission 
consistent with 19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(v). 
If Commerce finds that a PMS exists 
under section 773(e) of the Act, then it 
will modify its dumping calculations 
appropriately. 
Neither section 773(e) of the Act nor 
19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(v) set a deadline 
for the submission of PMS allegations 
and supporting factual information. 
However, in order to administer section 
773(e) of the Act, Commerce must 
receive PMS allegations and supporting 
factual information with enough time to 
consider the submission. Thus, should 
an interested party wish to submit a 
PMS allegation and supporting new 
factual information pursuant to section 
773(e) of the Act, it must do so no later 
than 20 days after submission of initial 
responses to section D of the 
questionnaire. 
Separate Rates 
In proceedings involving non-market 
economy (NME) countries, Commerce 
begins with a rebuttable presumption 
that all companies within the country 
are subject to government control and, 
thus, should be assigned a single AD 
deposit rate. It is Commerce’s policy to 
assign all exporters of merchandise 
subject to an administrative review in 
an NME country this single rate unless 
an exporter can demonstrate that it is 
sufficiently independent so as to be 
entitled to a separate rate. 
To establish whether a firm is 
sufficiently independent from 
government control of its export 
activities to be entitled to a separate 
rate, Commerce analyzes each entity 
exporting the subject merchandise. In 
accordance with the separate rates 
criteria, Commerce assigns separate 
rates to companies in NME cases only 
if respondents can demonstrate the 
absence of both de jure and de facto government control over export 
activities. 
All firms listed below that wish to 
qualify for separate rate status in the 
administrative reviews involving NME 
countries must complete, as 
appropriate, either a Separate Rate 
Application or Certification, as 
described below. In addition, all firms 
that wish to qualify for separate rate 
status in the administrative reviews of 
AD orders in which a Q&V 
questionnaire is issued must complete, 
as appropriate, either a Separate Rate 
Application or Certification, and 
respond to the Q&V questionnaire. 
For these administrative reviews, in 
order to demonstrate separate rate 
eligibility, Commerce requires entities 
for whom a review was requested, that 
were assigned a separate rate in the 
most recent segment of this proceeding 
in which they participated, to certify

Such entities include entities that have not 
participated in the proceeding, entities that were 
preliminarily granted a separate rate in any 
currently incomplete segment of the proceeding 
(e.g., an ongoing administrative review, new shipper review, etc.) and entities that lost their 
separate rate in the most recently completed 
segment of the proceeding in which they 
participated.

rather than trade names, need to be addressed via

that they continue to meet the criteria 
for obtaining a separate rate. The 
Separate Rate Certification form will be 
available on Commerce’s website at 
https://access.trade.gov/Resources/nme/ 
nme-sep-rate.html on the date of publication of this Federal Register 
notice. In responding to the 
certification, please follow the 
‘‘Instructions for Filing the 
Certification’’ in the Separate Rate 
Certification. Separate Rate 
Certifications are due to Commerce no 
later than 14 calendar days after 
publication of this Federal Register 
notice. In addition to filing a Separate 
Rate Certification with Commerce no 
later than 14 calendar days after 
publication of this Federal Register 
notice. The deadline and requirement 
for submitting a Separate Rate 
Certification applies equally to NME- 
owned firms, wholly foreign-owned 
firms, and foreign sellers who purchase 
and export subject merchandise to the 
United States. 
Entities that currently do not have a 
separate rate from a completed segment 
of the proceeding
2
should timely file a 
Separate Rate Application to 
demonstrate eligibility for a separate 
rate in this proceeding. In addition, 
companies that received a separate rate 
in a completed segment of the 
proceeding that have subsequently 
made changes, including, but not 
limited to, changes to corporate 
structure, acquisitions of new 
companies or facilities, or changes to 
their official company name,
3
should 
timely file a Separate Rate Application 
to demonstrate eligibility for a separate 
rate in this proceeding. The Separate 
Rate Application will be available on 
Commerce’s website at https://access.
trade.gov/Resources/nme/nme-sep- 
rate.html on the date of publication of this Federal Register notice. In responding to the Separate Rate 
Application, refer to the instructions 
contained in the application. Separate 
Rate Applications are due to Commerce 
no later than 14 calendar days after 
publication of this Federal Register 
notice. The deadline and requirement 
for submitting a Separate Rate 
Application applies equally to NME- 
owned firms, wholly foreign-owned 
firms, and foreign sellers that purchase 
and export subject merchandise to the 
United States. 
Exporters and producers must file a 
timely Separate Rate Application or 
Certification if they want to be 
considered for individual examination. 
Furthermore, exporters and producers 
who submit a Separate Rate Application 
or Certification and subsequently are 
selected as mandatory respondents will 
no longer be eligible for separate rate 
status unless they respond to all parts of 
the questionnaire as mandatory 
respondents. 
Certification Eligibility 
Commerce may establish a 
certification process for companies 
whose exports to the United States 
could contain both subject and non- 
subject merchandise. Companies under 
review that were deemed to not be 
eligible to participate in the certification 
program of that proceeding may submit 
a Certification Eligibility Application to 
establish that they maintain the 
necessary systems to track their sales to 
the United States of subject and non- 
subject goods. 
All firms listed below that are not 
currently eligible to certify but wish to 
establish certification eligibility are 
required to submit a Certification 
Eligibility Application. The Certification 
Eligibility Application will be available 
on Commerce’s website at https://
access.trade.gov/Resources/ 
Certification-Eligibility-Application.pdf. 
Certification Eligibility Applications 
must be filed according to Commerce’s 
regulations and are due to Commerce no 
later than 30 calendar days after the 
publication of the Federal Register 
notice. 
Exporters and producers that are not 
currently eligible to certify, who submit 
a Certification Eligibility Application, 
and are subsequently selected as 
mandatory respondents must respond to 
all parts of the questionnaire as 
mandatory respondents for Commerce 
to consider their Certification Eligibility 
Application.

Duty Absorption Reviews 
During any administrative review 
covering all or part of a period falling 
between the first and second or third 
and fourth anniversary of the 
publication of an AD order under 19 
CFR 351.211 or a determination under 
19 CFR 351.218(f)(4) to continue an 
order or suspended investigation (after 
sunset review), Commerce, if requested 
by a domestic interested party within 30 
days of the date of publication of the 
notice of initiation of the review, will 
determine whether antidumping duties 
have been absorbed by an exporter or 
producer subject to the review if the 
subject merchandise is sold in the 
United States through an importer that 
is affiliated with such exporter or 
producer. The request must include the 
name(s) of the exporter or producer for 
which the inquiry is requested. 
Gap Period Liquidation 
For the first administrative review of 
any order, there will be no assessment 
of antidumping or countervailing duties 
on entries of subject merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption during the relevant 
‘‘gap’’ period of the order (i.e., the period following the expiry of 
provisional measures and before 
definitive measures were put into 
place), if such a gap period is applicable 
to the POR.

Administrative Protective Orders and 
Letters of Appearance 
Interested parties must submit 
applications for disclosure under 
administrative protective orders in 
accordance with the procedures 
outlined in Commerce’s regulations at 
19 CFR 351.305. Those procedures 
apply to administrative reviews 
included in this notice of initiation. 
Parties wishing to participate in any of 
these administrative reviews should 
ensure that they meet the requirements 
of these procedures (e.g., the filing of separate letters of appearance as 
discussed at 19 CFR 351.103(d)). 
Factual Information Requirements 
Commerce’s regulations identify five 
categories of factual information in 19 
CFR 351.102(b)(21), which are 
summarized as follows: (i) evidence 
submitted in response to questionnaires; 
(ii) evidence submitted in support of 
allegations; (iii) publicly available 
information to value factors under 19 
CFR 351.408(c) or to measure the 
adequacy of remuneration under 19 CFR 
351.511(a)(2); (iv) evidence placed on 
the record by Commerce; and (v) 
evidence other than factual information 
described in (i)–(iv). These regulations 
require any party, when submitting 
factual information, to specify under 
which subsection of 19 CFR 
351.102(b)(21) the information is being 
submitted and, if the information is 
submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct 
factual information already on the 
record, to provide an explanation 
identifying the information already on 
the record that the factual information 
seeks to rebut, clarify, or correct. The 
regulations, at 19 CFR 351.301, also 
provide specific time limits for such 
factual submissions based on the type of 
factual information being submitted. 
Please review the Final Rule,
8
available 
at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/ FR-2013-07-17/pdf/2013-17045.pdf, 
prior to submitting factual information 
in this segment. Note that Commerce 
has amended certain of its requirements 
pertaining to the service of documents 
in 19 CFR 351.303(f).
9
 
Any party submitting factual 
information in an AD or CVD 
proceeding must certify to the accuracy 
and completeness of that information 
using the formats provided at the end of 
the Final Rule.10
Commerce intends to 
reject factual submissions in any 
proceeding segments if the submitting 
party does not comply with applicable 
certification requirements. 
Extension of Time Limits Regulation 
Parties may request an extension of 
time limits before a time limit 
established under Part 351 expires, or as 
otherwise specified by Commerce.
11
In 
general, an extension request will be 
considered untimely if it is filed after 
the time limit established under Part 
351 expires. For submissions which are 
due from multiple parties 
simultaneously, an extension request 
will be considered untimely if it is filed 
after 10:00 a.m. on the due date. 
Examples include, but are not limited 
to: (1) case and rebuttal briefs, filed 
pursuant to 19 CFR 351.309; (2) factual 
information to value factors under 19 
CFR 351.408(c), or to measure the 
adequacy of remuneration under 19 CFR 
351.511(a)(2), filed pursuant to 19 CFR 
351.301(c)(3) and rebuttal, clarification 
and correction filed pursuant to 19 CFR 
351.301(c)(3)(iv); (3) comments 
concerning the selection of a surrogate 
country and surrogate values and 
rebuttal; (4) comments concerning CBP 
data; and (5) Q&V questionnaires. Under 
certain circumstances, Commerce may 
elect to specify a different time limit by 
which extension requests will be 
considered untimely for submissions 
which are due from multiple parties 
simultaneously. In such a case, 
Commerce will inform parties in the 
letter or memorandum setting forth the 
deadline (including a specified time) by 
which extension requests must be filed 
to be considered timely. This policy also 
requires that an extension request must 
be made in a separate, standalone 
submission, and clarifies the 
circumstances under which Commerce 
will grant untimely-filed requests for the 
extension of time limits. Please review 
the Final Rule, available at https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-09-20/ 
html/2013-22853.htm, prior to submitting factual information in these 
segments.

The revised 
deadline for the initiation of these 
investigations is now December 29, 
2025.
5
 
Between November 14 and December 
9, 2025, Commerce requested 
supplemental information pertaining to 
certain aspects of the Petitions in 
supplemental questionnaires.
6
Between 
November 18 and December 11, 2025, 
the petitioner filed timely responses to 
these requests for additional 
information.
7
 
In accordance with section 732(b) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the 
Act), the petitioner alleges that imports 
of chromium trioxide from India and 
Tu¨rkiye are being, or are likely to be, 
sold in the United States at less than fair 
value (LTFV) within the meaning of 
section 731 of the Act, and that imports 
of such products are materially injuring, 
or threatening material injury to, the 
chromium trioxide industry in the 
United States. Consistent with section 
732(b)(1) of the Act, the Petitions were 
accompanied by information reasonably 
available to the petitioner supporting its 
allegations. 
Commerce finds that the petitioner 
filed the Petitions on behalf of the 
domestic industry, because the 
petitioner is an interested party, as 
defined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act. 
Commerce also finds that the petitioner 
demonstrated sufficient industry 
support for the initiation of the 
requested LTFV investigations.
8
 
Periods of Investigation 
Because the Petitions were filed on 
September 29, 2025, pursuant to 19 CFR 
351.204(b)(1), the period of 
investigation (POI) for the India and 
Tu¨rkiye LTFV investigations is July 1, 
2024, through June 30, 2025. 
Scope of the Investigations 
The product covered by these 
investigations is chromium trioxide 
from India and Tu¨rkiye. For a full 
description of the scope of these 
investigations, see the appendix to this notice. 
Comments on the Scope of the 
Investigations 
On November 17, 2025, Commerce 
requested information and clarification 
from the petitioner regarding the 
proposed scope to ensure that the scope 
language in the Petitions is an accurate 
reflection of the products for which the 
domestic industry is seeking relief.
9
On 
November 20, 2025, the petitioner 
provided clarifications and revised the 
scope.
10
The description of merchandise 
covered by these investigations, as 
described in the appendix to this notice, 
reflects these clarifications. 
As discussed in the Preamble to Commerce’s regulations, we are setting 
aside a period for interested parties to 
raise issues regarding product coverage 
(i.e., scope).11
Commerce will consider 
all scope comments received from 
interested parties and, if necessary, will 
consult with interested parties prior to 
the issuance of the preliminary 
determinations. If scope comments 
include factual information, all such 
factual information should be limited to 
public information.
12
Commerce 
requests that interested parties provide 
at the beginning of their scope 
comments a public executive summary 
for each comment or issue raised in 
their submission. Commerce further 
requests that interested parties limit 
their public executive summary of each 
comment or issue to no more than 450 
words, not including citations. 
Commerce intends to use the public 
executive summaries as the basis of the 
comment summaries included in the 
analysis of scope comments. To 
facilitate preparation of its 
questionnaires, Commerce requests that 
scope comments be submitted by 5:00 
p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on January 20, 
2026, which is the next business day 
after 20 calendar days from the 
signature date of this notice.
13
Any 
rebuttal comments, which may include 
factual information, and should also be 
limited to public information, must be 
filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on January 30, 
2026, which is 10 calendar days from 
the initial comment deadline. 
Commerce requests that any factual 
information that parties consider 
relevant to the scope of these 
investigations be submitted during that 
period. However, if a party subsequently 
finds that additional factual information 
pertaining to the scope of the 
investigations may be relevant, the party 
must contact Commerce and request 
permission to submit the additional 
information. All scope comments must 
be filed simultaneously on the records 
of the concurrent LTFV and CVD 
investigations. 
Filing Requirements 
All submissions to Commerce must be 
filed electronically via Enforcement and 
Compliance’s Antidumping Duty and 
Countervailing Duty Centralized 
Electronic Service System (ACCESS), 
unless an exception applies.
14
An 
electronically filed document must be

Comments on Product Characteristics 
Commerce is providing interested 
parties an opportunity to comment on 
the appropriate physical characteristics 
of chromium trioxide to be reported in 
response to Commerce’s AD 
questionnaires. This information will be 
used to identify the key physical 
characteristics of the subject 
merchandise in order to report the 
relevant cost of production (COP) 
accurately, as well as to develop 
appropriate product comparison 
criteria. 
Interested parties may provide any 
information or comments that they feel 
are relevant to the development of an 
accurate list of physical characteristics. 
Specifically, they may provide 
comments as to which characteristics 
are appropriate to use as: (1) general 
product characteristics; and (2) product 
comparison criteria. We note that it is 
not always appropriate to use all 
product characteristics as product 
comparison criteria. We base product 
comparison criteria on meaningful 
commercial differences among products. 
In other words, although there may be 
some physical product characteristics 
utilized by manufacturers to describe 
chromium trioxide, it may be that only 
a select few product characteristics take 
into account commercially meaningful 
physical characteristics. In addition, 
interested parties may comment on the 
order in which the physical 
characteristics should be used in 
matching products. Generally, 
Commerce attempts to list the most 
important physical characteristics first 
and the least important characteristics 
last. 
In order to consider the suggestions of 
interested parties in developing and 
issuing the AD questionnaires, all 
product characteristics comments must 
be filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on January 20, 
2026, which is the next business day 
after 20 calendar days from the 
signature date of this notice.
15
Any 
rebuttal comments must be filed by 5:00 
p.m. ET on January 30, 2026, which is 
10 calendar days from the initial 
comment deadline. All comments and 
submissions to Commerce must be filed 
electronically using ACCESS, as 
explained above, on the record of the 
each of the LTFV investigations. 
Determination of Industry Support for 
the Petitions 
Section 732(b)(1) of the Act requires 
that a petition be filed on behalf of the 
domestic industry. Section 732(c)(4)(A) 
of the Act provides that a petition meets 
this requirement if the domestic 
producers or workers who support the 
petition account for: (i) at least 25 
percent of the total production of the 
domestic like product; and (ii) more 
than 50 percent of the production of the 
domestic like product produced by that 
portion of the industry expressing 
support for, or opposition to, the 
petition. Moreover, section 732(c)(4)(D) 
of the Act provides that, if the petition 
does not establish support of domestic 
producers or workers accounting for 
more than 50 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like product, 
Commerce shall: (i) poll the industry or 
rely on other information in order to 
determine if there is support for the 
petition, as required by subparagraph 
(A); or (ii) determine industry support 
using a statistically valid sampling 
method to poll the ‘‘industry.’’ 
Section 771(4)(A) of the Act defines 
the ‘‘industry’’ as the producers as a 
whole of a domestic like product. Thus, 
to determine whether a petition has the 
requisite industry support, the statute 
directs Commerce to look to producers 
and workers who produce the domestic 
like product. The U.S. International 
Trade Commission (ITC), which is 
responsible for determining whether 
‘‘the domestic industry’’ has been 
injured, must also determine what 
constitutes a domestic like product in 
order to define the industry. While both 
Commerce and the ITC apply the same 
statutory definition regarding the 
domestic like product,
16
they do so for 
different purposes and pursuant to a 
separate and distinct authority. In 
addition, Commerce’s determination is 
subject to limitations of time and 
information. Although this may result in 
different definitions of the like product, 
such differences do not render the 
decision of either agency contrary to 
law.
17
 
Section 771(10) of the Act defines the 
domestic like product as ‘‘a product 
which is like, or in the absence of like, 
most similar in characteristics and uses 
with, the article subject to an 
investigation under this title.’’ Thus, the 
reference point from which the 
domestic like product analysis begins is 
‘‘the article subject to an investigation’’ 
(i.e., the class or kind of merchandise to be investigated, which normally will be 
the scope as defined in the petition). 
With regard to the domestic like 
product, the petitioner does not offer a 
definition of the domestic like product 
distinct from the scope of the 
investigations.
18
Based on our analysis 
of the information submitted on the 
record, we have determined that 
chromium trioxide, as defined in the 
scope, constitutes a single domestic like 
product, and we have analyzed industry 
support in terms of that domestic like 
product.
19
 
In determining whether the petitioner 
has standing under section 732(c)(4)(A) 
of the Act, we considered the industry 
support data contained in the Petitions 
with reference to the domestic like 
product as defined in the ‘‘Scope of the 
Investigations,’’ in the appendix to this 
notice. To establish industry support, 
the petitioner identified itself as the sole 
producer of the domestic like product; 
therefore, the Petitions are supported by 
100 percent of the U.S. industry.
20
We 
relied on data provided by the petitioner 
for purposes of measuring industry 
support.
21
 
Our review of the data provided in the 
Petitions, the General Issues 
Supplement, and other information 
readily available to Commerce indicates 
that the petitioner has established 
industry support for the Petitions.
22
 
First, the Petitions established support 
from domestic producers (or workers) 
accounting for more than 50 percent of 
the total production of the domestic like 
product and, as such, Commerce is not 
required to take further action in order 
to evaluate industry support (e.g., 
polling).
23
Second, the domestic 
producers (or workers) have met the 
statutory criteria for industry support 
under section 732(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act 
because the domestic producers (or 
workers) who the Petitions account for

In accordance with section 773(b)(2) of the Act, 
for these investigations, Commerce will request 
information necessary to calculate the constructed 
value (CV) and COP to determine whether there are 
reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales 
of the foreign like product have been made at prices 
that represent less than the COP of the product.

at least 25 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like 
product.
24
Finally, the domestic 
producers (or workers) have met the 
statutory criteria for industry support 
under section 732(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act 
because the domestic producers (or 
workers) who support the Petitions 
account for more than 50 percent of the 
production of the domestic like product 
produced by that portion of the industry 
expressing support for, or opposition to, 
the Petitions.
25
Accordingly, Commerce 
determines that the Petitions were filed 
on behalf of the domestic industry 
within the meaning of section 732(b)(1) 
of the Act.
26
 
Allegations and Evidence of Material 
Injury and Causation 
The petitioner alleges that the U.S. 
industry producing the domestic like 
product is being materially injured, or is 
threatened with material injury, by 
reason of the imports of the subject 
merchandise sold at LTFV. In addition, 
the petitioner alleges that subject 
imports exceed the negligibility 
threshold provided for under section 
771(24)(A) of the Act.
27
 
The petitioner contends that the 
industry’s injured condition is 
illustrated by a significant increase in 
the volume of subject imports; increased 
market share of subject imports; 
underselling and price suppression; lost 
sales and revenues; declines in 
production, capacity utilization, and 
U.S. shipments; and negative impact on 
financial performance.
28
We assessed 
the allegations and supporting evidence 
regarding material injury, threat of 
material injury, causation, cumulation, 
as well as negligibility, and we have 
determined that these allegations are 
properly supported by adequate 
evidence, and meet the statutory 
requirements for initiation.
29
 
Allegations of Sales at LTFV 
The following is a description of the 
allegations of sales at LTFV upon which 
Commerce based its decision to initiate 
LTFV investigations of imports of 
chromium trioxide from India and 
Tu¨rkiye. The sources of data for the 
deductions and adjustments relating to 
U.S. price and normal value (NV) are 
discussed in greater detail in the 
Country-Specific AD Initiation 
Checklists. 
U.S. Price 
For India, the petitioner based export 
price (EP) on the POI average unit value 
(AUV) derived from official import 
statistics for imports of chromium 
trioxide produced in and exported from 
India.
30
For Tu¨rkiye, the petitioner 
based EP on pricing information for 
chromium trioxide produced in Tu¨rkiye 
and sold or offered for sale in the U.S. 
market.
31
For each country, the 
petitioner made certain adjustments to 
U.S. price to calculate a net ex-factory 
U.S. price, where applicable.
32
 
Normal Value
33
 
The petitioner calculated NV on home 
market pricing information it obtained 
for chromium trioxide produced in and 
sold, or offered for sale, in India and 
Tu¨rkiye during the POI.
34
 
Fair Value Comparisons 
Based on the data provided by the 
petitioner, there is reason to believe that 
imports of chromium trioxide from 
India and Tu¨rkiye are being, or are 
likely to be, sold in the United States at 
LTFV. Based on comparisons of EP to 
NV in accordance with sections 772 and 
773 of the Act, the estimated dumping 
margins for chromium trioxide for each 
of the countries covered by this 
initiation are as follows: (1) India— 
14.44 percent; (2) Tu¨rkiye—40.88 
percent.
35
 
Initiation of LTFV Investigations 
Based upon the examination of the 
Petitions and supplemental responses, 
we find that they meet the requirements 
of section 732 of the Act. Therefore, we 
are initiating LTFV investigations to 
determine whether imports of 
chromium trioxide from India and 
Tu¨rkiye are being, or are likely to be, 
sold in the United States at LTFV. In 
accordance with section 733(b)(1)(A) of 
the Act and 19 CFR 351.205(b)(1), 
unless postponed, we will make our 
preliminary determinations no later 
than 140 days after the date of this 
initiation. 
Respondent Selection 
In the Petitions, the petitioner 
identified one company in India (i.e., 
Vishnu Chemicals Limited) and one 
company in Tu¨rkiye (i.e., Turkiye Sise ve Cam Fabrikalari AS (S¸is¸ecam Dis 
Ticaret A.S)) as producers/exporters of 
chromium trioxide.
36
We currently 
know of no additional producers/ 
exporters of chromium trioxide from 
India and Tu¨rkiye. 
Accordingly, Commerce intends to 
individually examine all known 
producers/exporters in the 
investigations from these countries (i.e., 
the companies cited above). We invite 
interested parties to comment on this 
issue. Such comments may include 
factual information within the meaning 
of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21). Parties 
wishing to comment must do so within 
three business days of the publication of 
this notice in the Federal Register. 
Comments must be filed electronically 
using ACCESS. An electronically filed 
document must be received successfully 
in its entirety via ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. 
ET on the specified deadline. Because 
we intend to examine all known 
producers/exporters in India and 
Tu¨rkiye, if no comments are received or 
if comments received further support 
the existence of these sole producers/ 
exporters in the respective countries, we 
do not intend to conduct respondent 
selection and will proceed to issuing the 
initial AD questionnaires to the 
companies identified. However, if 
comments are received which create a 
need for a respondent selection process, 
we intend to finalize our decisions 
regarding respondent selection within 
20 days of publication of this notice. 
Distribution of Copies of the Petitions 
In accordance with section 
732(b)(3)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.202(f), copies of the public version 
of the Petitions have been provided to 
the Governments of India and Tu¨rkiye 
via ACCESS. To the extent practicable, 
we will attempt to provide a copy of the 
public version of the Petitions to each 
exporter named in the Petitions, as 
provided under 19 CFR 351.203(c)(2). 
ITC Notification 
Commerce will notify the ITC of our 
initiation, as required by section 732(d) 
of the Act. 
Preliminary Determinations by the ITC 
The ITC will preliminarily determine 
no later than December 30, 2025,

already on the record, to provide an 
explanation identifying the information 
already on the record that the factual 
information seeks to rebut, clarify, or 
correct.
40
Time limits for the 
submission of factual information are 
addressed in 19 CFR 351.301, which 
provides specific time limits based on 
the type of factual information being 
submitted. Interested parties should 
review the regulations prior to 
submitting factual information in these 
investigations. 
Particular Market Situation Allegation 
Section 773(e) of the Act addresses 
the concept of particular market 
situation (PMS) for purposes of CV, 
stating that ‘‘if a particular market 
situation exists such that the cost of 
materials and fabrication or other 
processing of any kind does not 
accurately reflect the cost of production 
in the ordinary course of trade, the 
administering authority may use 
another calculation methodology under 
this subtitle or any other calculation 
methodology.’’ When an interested 
party submits a PMS allegation pursuant 
to section 773(e) of the Act (i.e., a cost- based PMS allegation), the submission 
must be filed in accordance with the 
requirements of 19 CFR 351.416(b), and 
Commerce will respond to such a 
submission consistent with 19 CFR 
351.301(c)(2)(v). If Commerce finds that 
a cost-based PMS exists under section 
773(e) of the Act, then it will modify its 
dumping calculations appropriately. 
Neither section 773(e) of the Act, nor 
19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(v), sets a deadline 
for the submission of cost-based PMS 
allegations and supporting factual 
information. However, in order to 
administer section 773(e) of the Act, 
Commerce must receive PMS allegations 
and supporting factual information with 
enough time to consider the submission. 
Thus, should an interested party wish to 
submit a cost-based PMS allegation and 
supporting new factual information 
pursuant to section 773(e) of the Act, it 
must do so no later than 20 days after 
submission of a respondent’s initial 
section D questionnaire response. 
We note that a PMS allegation filed 
pursuant to sections 773(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III) 
or 773(a)(1)(C)(iii) of the Act (i.e., a sales-based PMS allegation) must be 
filed within 10 days of submission of a 
respondent’s initial section B 
questionnaire response, in accordance 
with 19 CFR 351.301(c)(2)(i) and 19 CFR 
351.404(c)(2). 
Extensions of Time Limits 
Parties may request an extension of 
time limits before the expiration of a 
time limit established under 19 CFR 
351.301, or as otherwise specified by 
Commerce. In general, an extension 
request will be considered untimely if it 
is filed after the expiration of the time 
limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, 
or as otherwise specified by 
Commerce.
41
For submissions that are 
due from multiple parties 
simultaneously, an extension request 
will be considered untimely if it is filed 
after 10:00 a.m. ET on the due date. 
Under certain circumstances, Commerce 
may elect to specify a different time 
limit by which extension requests will 
be considered untimely for submissions 
which are due from multiple parties 
simultaneously. In such a case, we will 
inform parties in a letter or 
memorandum of the deadline (including 
a specified time) by which extension 
requests must be filed to be considered 
timely. An extension request must be 
made in a separate, standalone 
submission; under limited 
circumstances we will grant untimely 
filed requests for the extension of time 
limits, where we determine, based on 19 
CFR 351.302, that extraordinary 
circumstances exist. Parties should 
review Commerce’s regulations 
concerning the extension of time limits 
and the Time Limits Final Rule prior to 
submitting factual information in these 
investigations.
42
 
Certification Requirements 
Any party submitting factual 
information in an AD or CVD 
proceeding must certify to the accuracy 
and completeness of that information.
43
 
Parties must use the certification 
formats provided in 19 CFR 
351.303(g).
44
Commerce intends to 
reject factual submissions if the 
submitting party does not comply with 
the applicable certification 
requirements. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
Interested parties must submit 
applications for disclosure under APO 
in accordance with 19 CFR 351.305. 
Parties wishing to participate in these 
investigations should ensure that they 
meet the requirements of 19 CFR 
351.103(d) (e.g., by filing the required letter of appearance). Note that 
Commerce has amended certain of its 
requirements pertaining to the service of 
documents in 19 CFR 351.303(f).

2021) (Final Rule) (‘‘It is our expectation that the 
Federal Register list will include, where 
appropriate, for each scope application the 
following data: (1) identification of the AD and/or 
CVD orders at issue; (2) a concise public summary 
of the product’s description, including the physical 
characteristics (including chemical, dimensional 
and technical characteristics) of the product; (3) the 
country(ies) where the product is produced and the 
country from where the product is exported; (4) the 
full name of the applicant; and (5) the date that the 
scope application was filed with Commerce.’’). 
2
The products are micro channel heat exchangers 
(MCHE) that are part of HVAC or refrigeration 
systems that are used for efficient heat transfer in 
automobile, residential, and industrial applications. 
MCHEs are comprised of multiple aluminum 
extrusion parts and non-aluminum extrusion parts 
and may be produced to various configurations and 
dimensions but typically contain extruded 
aluminum micro channel tubing, aluminum 
headers or manifolds, which are the side pieces in 
which the extruded tubing are inserted into, and 
which are normally made of aluminum extrusions 
(usually 3xxx-series alloy) or aluminum sheet, 
aluminum fins between the micro channel tubing, 
which are normally made from aluminum sheet, 
and brackets, reinforcements, or side sheets which 
help keep other components (the ‘‘core’’) in place. 
The brackets are normally made from aluminum 
sheet, while the reinforcements and side sheets are 
normally made of aluminum extrusions. 
3
The products are colored pencils that feature a 
barrel color that closely matches the pigment of the 
core. The exterior is typically coated in a smooth, 
glossy finish. The writing on the barrel includes the 
Crayola brand name, the color name (e.g., ‘‘Sky Blue’’ or ‘‘Burnt Sienna’’), and sometimes a product 
line identifier such as ‘‘Signature Blend & Shade.’’ 
This labeling is printed in contrasting ink, usually 
white or silver. The product comes pre-sharpened 
and measures about 7 inches in length with a barrel 
roughly 7 mm in diameter. The core, approximately 
3 mm thick, is composed of a non-toxic blend of 
pigments, binders, extenders, and water.

In accordance with 19 CFR 351.225(d)(2), within 
30 days after the filing of a scope ruling application, 
if Commerce determines that it intends to address 
the scope issue raised in the application in another 
segment of the proceeding (such as a circumvention 
inquiry under 19 CFR 351.226 or a covered 
merchandise inquiry under 19 CFR 351.227), it will

The product in dry form is generally 
referred to as chromium trioxide, which is 
the acidic anhydride of chromic acid. 
Chromium trioxide in solution form may be 
referred to as chromic acid. However, the dry 
form may also be marketed under the name 
chromic acid. 
A non-exhaustive list of other names used 
for the subject merchandise includes: 
chromic anhydride, chromic trioxide, 
chromium (VI) oxide, monochromium 
trioxide, chromia, chromium (VI) trioxide, 
trioxochromium, and chromtrioxid. A non- 
exhaustive list of trade names for the subject 
merchandise includes: 11910080KROMSAV– 
ANHIDRID IP, Aktivkohle, impra¨gniert, Typ 
PLWK, Chromsaure, and Chroomzuur. 
All chromium trioxide is covered by the 
scope of these investigations irrespective of 
purity, particle size, or physical form. 
Chromium trioxide is generally imported in 
dry form, including in the form of pellets, 
flakes, powders, or beads, but the scope 
includes chromium trioxide in solution form. 
Chromium trioxide that has been blended 
with another product or products other than 
water is included in the scope if the resulting 
mix contains 90 percent or more of 
chromium trioxide by total formula weight, 
such as chromium trioxide mixed with a 
catalyst to make the product ready for use in 
metal finishing applications. If chromium 
trioxide is imported blended with another 
product, only the chromium trioxide content 
of the blend is included within the scope. 
Subject merchandise also includes 
chromium trioxide that has been processed 
in a third country into a product that 
otherwise would be within the scope of these 
investigations, i.e., if any such further processing would not otherwise remove the 
merchandise from the scope of the 
investigation it is included in the scope of 
the investigation, including blending, flaking, 
mixing with water, or packaging. For 
example, the dry form of the subject 
merchandise may be imported into a third 
country and then processed into solution 
before shipment to the United States. Such a 
solution would be subject to the scope. 
The subject merchandise is provided for in 
subheading 2819.10.0000 of the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTSUS). In addition to 1333- 82–0, import 
documentation may also reflect CAS registry 
numbers 12324–05–9, 12324–08–2, and 
1362947–20–3. Although the HTSUS 
subheading and CAS registry numbers are 
provided for convenience and customs 
purposes, the written description of the 
scope is dispositive.

Commerce’s practice dictates that where a deadline 
falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the 
appropriate deadline is the next business day (in

appropriate deadline is the next 
business day.

Accordingly, if the 30th 
day after the filing of the application 
falls on a non-business day, the next 
business day will be considered the 
‘‘updated’’ 30th day, and if the 
application is not rejected or a scope 
inquiry initiated by or on that particular 
business day, the application will be 
deemed accepted and a scope inquiry 
will be deemed initiated on the next 
business day which follows the 
‘‘updated’’ 30th day.

In accordance with 19 CFR 
351.225(m)(2), if there are companion 
AD and CVD orders covering the same 
merchandise from the same country of 
origin, the scope inquiry will be 
conducted on the record of the AD 
proceeding. Further, please note that 
pursuant to 19 CFR 351.225(m)(1), 
Commerce may either apply a scope 
ruling to all products from the same 
country with the same relevant physical 
characteristics, (including chemical, 
dimensional, and technical 
characteristics) as the product at issue, 
on a country-wide basis, regardless of 
the producer, exporter, or importer of 
those products, or on a company- 
specific basis.

The Petition 
On September 29, 2025, the U.S. 
Department of Commerce (Commerce) 
received a countervailing duty (CVD) 
petition concerning imports of 
chromium trioxide from India, filed in 
proper form on behalf of American 
Chrome & Chemicals, Inc. (the 
petitioner), a domestic producer of 
chromium trioxide.

The CVD Petition 
was accompanied by antidumping duty 
(AD) petitions concerning imports of 
chromium trioxide from India and the 
Republic of Tu¨rkiye.

Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on 
November 14, 2025, Commerce tolled 
all deadlines in administrative 
proceedings by 47 days.

The revised 
deadline for the initiation of this 
investigation is now December 29,

In accordance with section 702(b)(1) 
of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended 
(the Act), the petitioner alleges that the 
Government of India (GOI) is providing 
countervailable subsidies, within the 
meaning of sections 701 and 771(5) of 
the Act, to producers of chromium 
trioxide from India, and that such 
imports are materially injuring, or 
threatening material injury to, the 
domestic industry producing chromium 
trioxide in the United States. Consistent 
with section 702(b)(1) of the Act and 19 
CFR 351.202(b), for those alleged 
programs on which we are initiating a 
CVD investigation, the Petition was 
accompanied by information reasonably 
available to the petitioner supporting its 
allegations. 
Commerce finds that the petitioner 
filed the Petition on behalf of the 
domestic industry, because the 
petitioner is an interested party, as 
defined in section 771(9)(C) of the Act. 
Commerce also finds that the petitioner 
demonstrated sufficient industry 
support with respect to the initiation of 
the requested CVD investigation.

Period of Investigation (POI) 
Because the Petition was filed on 
September 29, 2025, the POI is January 
1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

Scope of the Investigation 
The product covered by this 
investigation is chromium trioxide from 
India. For a full description of the scope 
of this investigation, see the appendix to this notice. 
Comments on the Scope of the 
Investigation 
On November 17, 2025, Commerce 
requested information and clarification 
from the petitioner regarding the 
proposed scope to ensure that the scope 
language in the Petition is an accurate 
reflection of the products for which the 
domestic industry is seeking relief.
10
On 
November 20, 2025, the petitioner 
provided clarifications and revised the 
scope.
11
The description of merchandise 
covered by this investigation, as 
described in the appendix to this notice, 
reflects these clarifications. 
As discussed in the Preamble to Commerce’s regulations, we are setting 
aside a period for interested parties to 
raise issues regarding product coverage 
(i.e., scope).12
Commerce will consider 
all scope comments received from 
interested parties and, if necessary, will 
consult with interested parties prior to 
the issuance of the preliminary 
determination. If scope comments 
include factual information, all such 
factual information should be limited to 
public information.
13
Commerce 
requests that interested parties provide 
at the beginning of their scope 
comments a public executive summary 
for each comment or issue raised in 
their submission. Commerce further 
requests that interested parties limit 
their public executive summary of each 
comment or issue to no more than 450 
words, not including citations. 
Commerce intends to use the public 
executive summaries as the basis of the 
comment summaries included in the 
analysis of scope comments. To 
facilitate preparation of its 
questionnaires, Commerce requests that 
scope comments be submitted by 5:00 
p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on January 20, 
2026, which is the next business day 
after 20 calendar days from the 
signature date of this notice.
14
Any 
rebuttal comments, which may include 
factual information, and should also be 
limited to public information, must be 
filed by 5:00 p.m. ET on January 30, 
2026, which is 10 calendar days from 
the initial comment deadline. 
Commerce requests that any factual 
information that parties consider 
relevant to the scope of this 
investigation be submitted during that 
period. However, if a party subsequently 
finds that additional factual information 
pertaining to the scope of the 
investigation may be relevant, the party 
must contact Commerce and request 
permission to submit the additional 
information. All scope comments must 
be filed simultaneously on the records 
of the concurrent AD and CVD 
investigations. 
Filing Requirements 
All submissions to Commerce must be 
filed electronically via ACCESS, unless 
an exception applies.
15
An 
electronically filed document must be 
received successfully in its entirety by 
the time and date it is due. 
Consultations 
Pursuant to sections 702(b)(4)(A)(i) 
and (ii) of the Act, Commerce notified 
the GOI of the receipt of the Petition and 
provided an opportunity for 
consultations with respect to the 
Petition.
16
The GOI did not request 
consultations. 
Determination of Industry Support for 
the Petition 
Section 702(b)(1) of the Act requires 
that a petition be filed on behalf of the 
domestic industry. Section 702(c)(4)(A) 
of the Act provides that a petition meets 
this requirement if the domestic 
producers or workers who support the 
petition account for: (i) at least 25 
percent of the total production of the 
domestic like product; and (ii) more 
than 50 percent of the production of the 
domestic like product produced by that 
portion of the industry expressing 
support for, or opposition to, the 
petition. Moreover, section 702(c)(4)(D) 
of the Act provides that, if the petition 
does not establish support of domestic 
producers or workers accounting for 
more than 50 percent of the total 
production of the domestic like product, 
Commerce shall: (i) poll the industry or 
rely on other information in order to 
determine if there is support for the 
petition, as required by subparagraph 
(A); or (ii) determine industry support 
using a statistically valid sampling 
method to poll the ‘‘industry.’’ 
Section 771(4)(A) of the Act defines 
the ‘‘industry’’ as the producers as a 
whole of a domestic like product. Thus, 
to determine whether a petition has the 
requisite industry support, the statute

Id. 
directs Commerce to look to producers 
and workers who produce the domestic 
like product. The U.S. International 
Trade Commission (ITC), which is 
responsible for determining whether 
‘‘the domestic industry’’ has been 
injured, must also determine what 
constitutes a domestic like product in 
order to define the industry. While both 
Commerce and the ITC must apply the 
same statutory definition regarding the 
domestic like product,
17
they do so for 
different purposes and pursuant to a 
separate and distinct authority. In 
addition, Commerce’s determination is 
subject to limitations of time and 
information. Although this may result in 
different definitions of the like product, 
such differences do not render the 
decision of either agency contrary to 
law.
18
 
Section 771(10) of the Act defines the 
domestic like product as ‘‘a product 
which is like, or in the absence of like, 
most similar in characteristics and uses 
with, the article subject to an 
investigation under this title.’’ Thus, the 
reference point from which the 
domestic like product analysis begins is 
‘‘the article subject to an investigation’’ 
(i.e., the class or kind of merchandise to be investigated, which normally will be 
the scope as defined in the petition). 
With regard to the domestic like 
product, the petitioner does not offer a 
definition of the domestic like product 
distinct from the scope of the 
investigation.
19
Based on our analysis of 
the information submitted on the 
record, we have determined that 
chromium trioxide, as defined in the 
scope, constitutes a single domestic like 
product, and we have analyzed industry 
support in terms of that domestic like 
product.
20
 
In determining whether the petitioner 
has standing under section 702(c)(4)(A) 
of the Act, we considered the industry 
support data contained in the Petition 
with reference to the domestic like 
product as defined in the ‘‘Scope of the 
Investigation,’’ in the appendix to this 
notice. To establish industry support, 
the petitioner provided its own 
production of the domestic like product 
in 2024.
21
The petitioner identified 
itself as the sole producer of the 
domestic like product; therefore, the 
Petition is supported by 100 percent of 
the U.S. industry.
22
We relied on data 
provided by the petitioner for purposes 
of measuring industry support.
23
 
Our review of the data provided in the 
Petition, the General Issues Supplement, 
and other information readily available 
to Commerce indicates that the 
petitioner has established industry 
support for the Petition.
24
First, the 
Petition established support from 
domestic producers (or workers) 
accounting for more than 50 percent of 
the total production of the domestic like 
product and, as such, Commerce is not 
required to take further action in order 
to evaluate industry support (e.g., 
polling).
25
Second, the domestic 
producers (or workers) have met the 
statutory criteria for industry support 
under section 702(c)(4)(A)(i) of the Act 
because the domestic producers (or 
workers) who support the Petition 
account for at least 25 percent of the 
total production of the domestic like 
product.
26
Finally, the domestic 
producers (or workers) have met the 
statutory criteria for industry support 
under section 702(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Act 
because the domestic producers (or 
workers) who support the Petition 
account for more than 50 percent of the 
production of the domestic like product 
produced by that portion of the industry 
expressing support for, or opposition to, 
the Petition.
27
Accordingly, Commerce 
determines that the Petition was filed on 
behalf of the domestic industry within 
the meaning of section 702(b)(1) of the 
Act.
28
 
Injury Test 
Because India is a ‘‘Subsidies 
Agreement Country’’ within the 
meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, 
section 701(a)(2) of the Act applies to 
this investigation. Accordingly, the ITC 
must determine whether imports of the 
subject merchandise from India 
materially injure, or threaten material 
injury to, a U.S. industry. 
Allegations and Evidence of Material 
Injury and Causation 
The petitioner alleges that imports of 
the subject merchandise are benefiting 
from countervailable subsidies and that 
such imports are causing, or threaten to 
cause, material injury to the U.S. 
industry producing the domestic like 
product. In addition, the petitioner 
alleges that subject imports exceed the 
negligibility threshold provided for 
under section 771(24)(A) of the Act.
29
 
The petitioner contends that the 
industry’s injured condition is 
illustrated by a significant increase in 
the volume of subject imports; increased 
market share of subject imports; lost 
sales and revenues; underselling and 
price suppression; declines in 
production, capacity utilization, and 
U.S. shipments; and negative impact on 
financial performance.
30
We assessed 
the allegations and supporting evidence 
regarding material injury, threat of 
material injury, causation, as well as 
negligibility, and we have determined 
that these allegations are properly 
supported by adequate evidence, and 
meet the statutory requirements for 
initiation.
31
 
Initiation of CVD Investigation 
Based upon the examination of the 
Petition and supplemental responses, 
we find that they meet the requirements 
of section 702 of the Act. Therefore, we 
are initiating a CVD investigation to 
determine whether imports of 
chromium trioxide from India benefit 
from countervailable subsidies 
conferred by the GOI. In accordance 
with section 703(b)(1) of the Act and 19 
CFR 351.205(b)(1), unless postponed, 
we will make our preliminary 
determination no later than 65 days 
after the date of this initiation. 
Based on our review of the Petition, 
we find that there is sufficient 
information to initiate a CVD 
investigation on 48 programs alleged by 
the petitioner. For a full discussion of 
the basis for our decision to initiate on 
each program, see the India CVD Initiation Checklist. A public version of 
the initiation checklist for this 
investigation is available on ACCESS.

Chemicals Limited (Vishnu)) in India as 
a producer/exporter of chromium 
trioxide and provided independent 
third-party information as support.
32
 
We currently know of no additional 
producers/exporters of chromium 
trioxide from India. 
Accordingly, Commerce intends to 
individually examine the only known 
producer/exporter in the investigation 
from India (i.e., Vishnu). We invite interested parties to comment on this 
issue. Such comments may include 
factual information within the meaning 
of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21). Parties 
wishing to comment must do so within 
three business days of the publication of 
this notice in the Federal Register. 
Comments must be filed electronically 
using ACCESS. An electronically filed 
document must be received successfully 
in its entirety via ACCESS by 5:00 p.m. 
ET on the specified deadline. Because 
we intend to examine the only known 
producer/exporter in India, if no 
comments are received or if comments 
received further support the existence of 
only this producer/exporter in India, we 
do not intend to conduct respondent 
selection and will proceed to issuing the 
initial CVD questionnaire to the 
company identified. However, if 
comments are received which create a 
need for a respondent selection process, 
we intend to finalize our decisions 
regarding respondent selection within 
20 days of publication of this notice. 
Distribution of Copies of the Petition 
In accordance with section 
702(b)(4)(A) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.202(f), a copy of the public version 
of the Petition has been provided to the 
GOI via ACCESS. To the extent 
practicable, we will attempt to provide 
a copy of the public version of the 
Petition to each exporter named in the 
Petition, as provided under 19 CFR 
351.203(c)(2). 
ITC Notification 
Commerce will notify the ITC of its 
initiation, as required by section 702(d) 
of the Act. 
Preliminary Determination by the ITC 
The ITC will preliminarily determine 
no later than December 30, 2025, 
whether there is a reasonable indication 
that imports of chromium trioxide from 
India are materially injuring, or 
threatening material injury to, a U.S. 
industry.
33
A negative ITC 
determination will result in the 
investigation being terminated.
34
 
Otherwise, this CVD investigation will 
proceed according to statutory and 
regulatory time limits. 
Submission of Factual Information 
Factual information is defined in 19 
CFR 351.102(b)(21) as: (i) evidence 
submitted in response to questionnaires; 
(ii) evidence submitted in support of 
allegations; (iii) publicly available 
information to value factors of 
production under 19 CFR 351.408(c) or 
to measure the adequacy of 
remuneration under 19 CFR 
351.511(a)(2); (iv) evidence placed on 
the record by Commerce; and (v) 
evidence other than factual information 
described in (i)–(iv). Section 351.301(b) 
of Commerce’s regulations requires any 
party, when submitting factual 
information, to specify under which 
subsection of 19 CFR 351.102(b)(21) the 
information is being submitted
35
and, if 
the information is submitted to rebut, 
clarify, or correct factual information 
already on the record, to provide an 
explanation identifying the information 
already on the record that the factual 
information seeks to rebut, clarify, or 
correct.
36
Time limits for the 
submission of factual information are 
addressed in 19 CFR 351.301, which 
provides specific time limits based on 
the type of factual information being 
submitted. Interested parties should 
review the regulations prior to 
submitting factual information in this 
investigation. 
Extensions of Time Limits 
Parties may request an extension of 
time limits before the expiration of a 
time limit established under 19 CFR 
351.301, or as otherwise specified by 
Commerce. In general, an extension 
request will be considered untimely if it 
is filed after the expiration of the time 
limit established under 19 CFR 351.301, 
or as otherwise specified by 
Commerce.
37
For submissions that are 
due from multiple parties 
simultaneously, an extension request 
will be considered untimely if it is filed 
after 10:00 a.m. ET on the due date. 
Under certain circumstances, Commerce 
may elect to specify a different time 
limit by which extension requests will 
be considered untimely for submissions 
which are due from multiple parties 
simultaneously. In such a case, we will 
inform parties in a letter or 
memorandum of the deadline (including 
a specified time) by which extension 
requests must be filed to be considered 
timely. An extension request must be 
made in a separate, standalone 
submission; under limited 
circumstances we will grant untimely 
filed requests for the extension of time 
limits, where we determine, based on 19 
CFR 351.302, that extraordinary 
circumstances exist. Parties should 
review Commerce’s regulations 
concerning the extension of time limits 
and the Time Limits Final Rule prior to 
submitting factual information in this 
investigation.
38
 
Certification Requirements 
Any party submitting factual 
information in an AD or CVD 
proceeding must certify to the accuracy 
and completeness of that information.
39
 
Parties must use the certification 
formats provided in 19 CFR 
351.303(g).

Appendix 
Scope of the Investigation 
The merchandise subject to this 
investigation is chromium trioxide (Chemical 
Abstracts Services (CAS) registry number 
1333–82–0), regardless of form (dry or 
solution). Chromium trioxide is an inorganic 
compound with the molecular formula CrO
3
 
in dry form and H
2
CrO
4
in solution form. All 
relevant formulas refer to same product with 
one unit of Chromium (as Cr+6) and three 
units of Oxygen, such as Cr
4
O
12
; and 
Cr
0.25
O
0.75
. 
The product in dry form is generally 
referred to as chromium trioxide, which is 
the acidic anhydride of chromic acid. 
Chromium trioxide in solution form may be 
referred to as chromic acid. However, the dry 
form may also be marketed under the name 
chromic acid. 
A non-exhaustive list of other names used 
for the subject merchandise includes: 
chromic anhydride, chromic trioxide, 
chromium (VI) oxide, monochromium 
trioxide, chromia, chromium (VI) trioxide, 
trioxochromium, and chromtrioxid. A non- 
exhaustive list of trade names for the subject 
merchandise includes: 11910080KROMSAV– 
ANHIDRID IP, Aktivkohle, impra¨gniert, Typ 
PLWK, Chromsaure, and Chroomzuur. 
All chromium trioxide is covered by the 
scope of this investigation irrespective of 
purity, particle size, or physical form. 
Chromium trioxide is generally imported in 
dry form, including in the form of pellets, 
flakes, powders, or beads, but the scope 
includes chromium trioxide in solution form. 
Chromium trioxide that has been blended 
with another product or products other than 
water is included in the scope if the resulting 
mix contains 90 percent or more of 
chromium trioxide by total formula weight, 
such as chromium trioxide mixed with a 
catalyst to make the product ready for use in 
metal finishing applications. If chromium 
trioxide is imported blended with another 
product, only the chromium trioxide content 
of the blend is included within the scope. 
Subject merchandise also includes 
chromium trioxide that has been processed 
in a third country into a product that 
otherwise would be within the scope of this 
investigation, i.e., if any such further processing would not otherwise remove the 
merchandise from the scope of the 
investigation it is included in the scope of 
the investigation, including blending, flaking, 
mixing with water, or packaging. For 
example, the dry form of the subject 
merchandise may be imported into a third 
country and then processed into solution 
before shipment to the United States. Such a 
solution would be subject to the scope. 
The subject merchandise is provided for in 
subheading 2819.10.0000 of the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States 
(HTSUS). In addition to 1333- 82–0, import 
documentation may also reflect CAS registry 
numbers 12324–05–9, 12324–08–2, and 
1362947–20–3. Although the HTSUS 
subheading and CAS registry numbers are 
provided for convenience and customs 
purposes, the written description of the 
scope is dispositive.

Background 
This preliminary determination is

The company that decided not to participate in 
this investigation and, therefore, did not respond to 
Commerce’s Q&V questionnaire is Kukdo 
Chemicals Co. Ltd (Kukdo Chemicals). 
12
With two respondents under examination, 
Commerce normally calculates: (A) a weighted- 
average of the estimated weighted-average dumping 
margins calculated for the examined respondents; 
(B) a simple average of the estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins calculated for the 
examined respondents; and (C) a weighted-average 
of the estimated weighted-average dumping margins 
calculated for the examined respondents using each 
company’s publicly-ranged U.S. sales values for the 
merchandise under consideration. Commerce then 
compares (B) and (C) to (A) and selects the rate 
closest to (A) as the most appropriate rate for all 
other producers and exporters. See, e.g., Ball 
Bearings and Parts Thereof from France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom: Final Results 
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews, Final 
Results of Changed-Circumstances Review, and

We preliminarily collapsed Green Chemical 
Co., Ltd. and Green Life Science. See Preliminary Decision Memorandum. 
Methodology 
Commerce is conducting this 
investigation in accordance with section 
731 of the Act. Commerce calculated 
export and constructed export prices in 
accordance with sections 772(a) and (b) 
of the Act, respectively. Normal value is 
calculated in accordance with section 
773 of the Act. Furthermore, pursuant to 
section 776(a) and (b) of the Act, 
Commerce has preliminarily relied 
upon facts otherwise available, with 
adverse inferences, to assign an 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin to Kukdo Chemicals Co. Ltd.

methodology underlying the 
preliminary determination, see the Preliminary Decision Memorandum. 
Preliminary Affirmative Determination 
Critical Circumstances, in Part 
On August 18, 2025, the petitioner
9
 
timely filed a critical circumstances 
allegation, pursuant to section 733(e)(1) 
of the Act and 19 CFR 351.206(c)(1), 
alleging that critical circumstances exist 
with respect to imports of the subject 
merchandise from Korea.
10
 
Section 733(e)(1) of the Act provides 
that Commerce will preliminarily 
determine that critical circumstances 
exist in an LTFV investigation if there 
is a reasonable basis to believe or 
suspect that: (A) there is a history of 
dumping and material injury by reason 
of dumped imports in the United States 
or elsewhere of the subject merchandise, 
or the person by whom, or for whose 
account, the merchandise was imported 
knew or should have known that the 
exporter was selling the subject 
merchandise at less than its fair value 
and that there was likely to be material 
injury by reason of such sales; and (B) 
there have been massive imports of the 
subject merchandise over a relatively 
short period. We preliminarily find that 
critical circumstances exist for imports 
of subject merchandise produced and/or 
exported by Green Chemical Co., Ltd. 
(Green Chemical). Because we 
preliminarily applied the adverse-facts- 
available (AFA) rate to the company that 
did not respond to our quantity and 
value questionnaire (i.e., the non- responsive company),
11
as AFA, we 
preliminarily find that critical 
circumstances exist for Kukdo 
Chemicals as well. In addition, we 
preliminarily find that critical 
circumstances do not exist for imports 
of subject merchandise produced and/or 
exported by Miwon Specialty Chemical 
Co., Ltd. (Miwon) and all other 
producers and/or exporters. For a full 
discussion of our preliminary critical 
circumstances determination, see the ‘‘Preliminary Critical Circumstances’’ 
section of the Preliminary Decision 
Memorandum. 
All-Others Rate 
Section 733(d)(1)(A)(ii) and 
735(c)(5)(A) of the Act provides that in 
the preliminary determination 
Commerce shall determine an estimated 
all-others rate for all exporters and 
producers not individually examined. 
This rate shall be an amount equal to 
the weighted average of the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins 
established for exporters and producers 
individually investigated, excluding any 
zero and de minimis margins, and any 
margins determined entirely under 
section 776 of the Act. 
In this investigation, Commerce 
calculated estimated weighted-average 
dumping margins for Green Chemical 
and Miwon that are not zero, de 
minimis, or based entirely on facts otherwise available. Commerce 
calculated the all-others rate using a 
weighted average of the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins 
calculated for the examined respondents 
using each company’s publicly-ranged 
values for the merchandise under 
consideration.
12
 
Preliminary Determination 
Commerce preliminarily determines 
that the following estimated weighted- 
average dumping margins exists:

* Rate is based on facts available with ad-
verse inferences. 
Suspension of Liquidation and Cash 
Deposit Requirements 
Section 733(e)(2) of the Act provides 
that, given an affirmative determination 
of critical circumstances, any 
suspension of liquidation shall apply to 
unliquidated entries of subject 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the later of: (a) the date which is 
90 days before the date on which the 
suspension of liquidation was first 
ordered; or (b) the date on which notice 
of initiation of the investigation was 
published. Commerce preliminarily 
finds that critical circumstances exist 
for imports of subject merchandise 
produced or exported by Green 
Chemical and Kukdo Chemicals. In 
accordance with section 733(e)(2)(A) of 
the Act, the suspension of liquidation 
shall apply to unliquidated entries of 
shipments of subject merchandise from 
Green Chemical and Kukdo Chemicals 
that were entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 
the date which is 90 days before the 
publication of this notice. 
In accordance with section 733(d)(2) 
of the Act, with regard to Miwon and all 
other exporters and/or producers of 
subject merchandise, Commerce will 
direct U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation 
of entries of subject merchandise, as 
described in Appendix I, entered, or 
withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register. 
Further, pursuant to section 
733(d)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 
351.205(d), Commerce will instruct CBP 
to require a cash deposit equal to the 
estimated weighted-average dumping 
margin or the estimated all-others rate, 
as follows: (1) the cash deposit rate for 
the respondents listed above will be 
equal to the company-specific estimated 
weighted-average dumping margins 
determined in this preliminary

may be submitted to the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement and 
Compliance no later than seven days 
after the date on which the last 
verification report is issued in this 
investigation. Rebuttal briefs, limited to 
issues raised in case briefs, may be 
submitted no later than five days after 
the deadline date for case briefs.
14
Note 
that Commerce has amended certain of 
its requirements pertaining to the 
service of documents in 19 CFR 
351.303(f).
15
Pursuant to 19 CFR 
351.309(c)(2) and (d)(2), parties who

summary of the argument; and (3) a 
table of authorities. 
As provided under 19 CFR 
351.309(c)(2)(iii) and (d)(2)(iii), we 
request that interested parties provide at 
the beginning of their briefs a public, 
executive summary for each issue raised 
in their briefs.
16
Further, we request that 
interested parties limit their executive 
summary of each issue to no more than 
450 words, not including citations. We 
intend to use the executive summaries 
as the basis of the comment summaries 
included in the issues and decision 
memorandum that will accompany the 
final determination in this investigation. 
We request that interested parties 
include footnotes for relevant citations 
in the executive summary of each issue. 
Note that Commerce has amended 
certain of its requirements pertaining to 
the service of documents in 19 CFR 
351.303(f).
17
 
Pursuant to 19 CFR 351.310(c), 
interested parties who wish to request a 
hearing, limited to issues raised in the 
case and rebuttal briefs, must submit a 
written request to the Assistant 
Secretary for Enforcement and 
Compliance, U.S. Department of 
Commerce, within 30 days after the date 
of publication of this notice in the 
Federal Register. Requests should 
contain the party’s name, address, and 
telephone number, the number of 
participants, whether any participant is 
a foreign national, and a list of the 
issues to be discussed. If a request for 
a hearing is made, Commerce intends to 
hold the hearing at a time and date to 
be determined. Parties should confirm 
by telephone the date, time, and 
location of the hearing two days before 
the scheduled date. 
Postponement of Final Determination 
and Extension of Provisional Measures 
Section 735(a)(2) of the Act provides 
that a final determination may be 
postponed until not later than 135 days 
after the date of the publication of the 
preliminary determination if, in the 
event of an affirmative preliminary 
determination, a request for such 
postponement is made by exporters who 
account for a significant proportion of 
exports of the subject merchandise, or in 
the event of a negative preliminary 
determination, a request for such 
postponement is made by the petitioner. 
Section 351.210(e)(2) of Commerce’s 
regulations requires that a request by 
exporters for postponement of the final 
determination be accompanied by a 
request for extension of provisional 
measures from a four-month period to a 
period not more than six months in 
duration. 
On November 24, 2025, pursuant to 
19 CFR 351.210(b)(2)(ii), Miwon 
requested that Commerce postpone the 
final determination and that provisional 
measures be extended to a period not to 
exceed six months;
18
on December 4, 
2025, Green Chemical also requested 
that Commerce postpone the final 
determination and extend the 
application of provisional measures by 
a corresponding period of extension.
19
 
On November, 21, 2025, the petitioner 
requested that Commerce postpone the 
final determination in the event of a 
negative preliminary determination.
20
 
In accordance with section 735(a)(2)(A) 
of the Act and 19 CFR 351.210(b)(2)(ii), 
because: (1) the preliminary 
determination is affirmative; (2) the 
requesting exporter accounts for a 
significant proportion of exports of the 
subject merchandise; and (3) no 
compelling reasons for denial exist, 
Commerce is postponing the final 
determination and extending the 
provisional measures from a four-month 
period to a period not greater than six 
months. Accordingly, Commerce will 
make its final determination no later 
than 135 days after the date of 
publication of this preliminary 
determination. 
U.S. International Trade Commission 
Notification 
In accordance with section 733(f) of 
the Act, Commerce will notify the U.S. 
International Trade Commission (ITC) of 
its preliminary determination. If the 
final determination is affirmative, the 
ITC will determine before the later of 
120 days after the date of this 
preliminary determination or 45 days 
after the final determination whether 
imports of monomers and oligomers 
from Korea are materially injuring, or 
threaten material injury to, the U.S. 
industry. 
Notification to Interested Parties 
This determination is issued and 
published in accordance with sections 
733(f) and 777(i)(1) of the Act, and 19 
CFR 351.205(c).

The monomers are generally known as 
multifunctional acrylates (MFAs) or 
multifunctional methacrylates (MFMAs) 
depending on whether the functional groups 
are acrylate or methacrylate. The monomers 
generally contain stabilizers/inhibitors, 
which include but are not limited to 
Hydroquinone, Methyl Hydroquinone, and 
Butylated Hydroxy Toluene. The monomers 
are either difunctional or trifunctional 
(having 2 or 3 functional groups/molecule), 
have viscosities of 9 to 15 centipoise (cPs) at 
25 degrees Celsius (if difunctional) or 44 to 
110 cPs at 25 degrees Celsius (if 
trifunctional), have (meth)acrylate equivalent 
weights (molecular weight per number of 
functional groups) between 99 and 158 and 
molecular weights between 226 and 472 
grams per mol. 
The acrylated bisphenol-A epoxy based 
oligomer is commonly referred to as epoxy 
acrylate or acrylated epoxy. In contrast to 
epoxy resin, the main characteristic of the 
epoxy acrylate oligomer is that it contains 
acrylate functional groups which make them 
curable by free-radical polymerization. The 
epoxy acrylate has a molecular weight 
between 508 to 536 grams per mol and a 
viscosity of 2400 to 3600 cPs at 65 degrees 
Celsius. The epoxy acrylate generally 
contains stabilizers/inhibitors, which include 
but are not limited to Hydroquinone, Methyl 
Hydroquinone, and Butylated Hydroxy 
Toluene. 
Certain monomers and oligomers are 
subject to the scope even if an in-scope 
monomer or oligomer is blended or mixed 
with one or more other in-scope monomers 
or oligomers. 
Certain monomers and oligomers in any 
blend or mixture are also subject to the 
scope, so long as the blend or mixture 
contains no less than 20 percent by weight 
of in-scope CMOs. 
The scope includes merchandise matching 
the above description that has been 
processed in a third country, including by 
commingling, diluting, introducing, or 
removing ingredients, or performing any 
other processing that would not otherwise 
remove the merchandise from the scope of 
the investigations if performed in the subject 
country. 
The scope also includes CMOs that are 
commingled, mixed or blended with in-scope 
product from sources not subject to these 
investigations. 
Only the subject component(s) of such 
blends, mixtures or commingled products 
described above is covered by the scope of 
these investigations. Subject merchandise 
contained in a blended, mixed or 
commingled product described above will 
not have undergone a chemical reaction as a 
result of being blended, mixed or 
commingled. 
Notwithstanding the above, specifically 
excluded from the scope are downstream 
products, including but not limited to, inks, 
coatings and overprint varnishes. For 
purposes of this exclusion, the downstream 
product requires only the application of 
energy to be cured, e.g., inks or varnish applied to packaging, coatings applied to 
wood flooring, etc. The energy source required to cure the downstream product to 
its substrate can be thermal, ultraviolet 
radiation, visible light, electron beam 
radiation, or infrared radiation. 
This merchandise is currently classifiable 
under Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
United States (HTSUS) subheadings 
2916.12.5050, 2916.14.2050, 3824.99.2900,

the scope issue raised in the application in another 
segment of the proceeding (such as a circumvention 
inquiry under 19 CFR 351.226 or a covered 
merchandise inquiry under 19 CFR 351.227), it will 
notify the applicant that it will not initiate a scope 
inquiry, but will instead determine if the product 
is covered by the scope at issue in that alternative 
segment. Due to the lapse in appropriations and 
Federal Government shutdown, on November 14, 
2025, Commerce tolled certain deadlines in 
administrative proceedings by 47 days. 
Additionally, on November 24, 2025, Commerce 
tolled certain deadlines by an additional 21 
calendar days.

Notification to Interested Parties 
This list of scope ruling applications 
is not an identification of scope 
inquiries that have been initiated. In 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.225(d)(1), 
if Commerce has not rejected a scope 
ruling application nor initiated the 
scope inquiry within 30 days after the 
filing of the application, the application 
will be deemed accepted and a scope 
inquiry will be deemed initiated the 
following day—day 31.
3
Commerce’s 
practice generally dictates that where a 
deadline falls on a weekend, Federal 
holiday, or other non-business day, the 
appropriate deadline is the next 
business day.
4
Accordingly, if the 30th 
day after the filing of the application 
falls on a non-business day, the next 
business day will be considered the 
‘‘updated’’ 30th day, and if the 
application is not rejected or a scope 
inquiry initiated by or on that particular 
business day, the application will be 
deemed accepted and a scope inquiry 
will be deemed initiated on the next 
business day which follows the 
‘‘updated’’ 30th day.
5
 
In accordance with 19 CFR 
351.225(m)(2), if there are companion 
AD and CVD orders covering the same 
merchandise from the same country of 
origin, the scope inquiry will be 
conducted on the record of the AD 
proceeding. Further, please note that 
pursuant to 19 CFR 351.225(m)(1), 
Commerce may either apply a scope 
ruling to all products from the same 
country with the same relevant physical 
characteristics, (including chemical, 
dimensional, and technical 
characteristics) as the product at issue, 
on a country-wide basis, regardless of 
the producer, exporter, or importer of 
those products, or on a company- 
specific basis. 
For further information on procedures 
for filing information with Commerce 
through ACCESS and participating in 
scope inquiries, please refer to the 
Filing Instructions section of the Scope 
Ruling Application Guide, at https://
access.trade.gov/help/Scope_Ruling_Guidance.pdf. Interested parties, apart from the scope ruling applicant, who 
wish to participate in a scope inquiry 
and be added to the public service list 
for that segment of the proceeding must 
file an entry of appearance in 
accordance with 19 CFR 351.103(d)(1) 
and 19 CFR 351.225(n)(4). Interested 
parties are advised to refer to the case 
segment in ACCESS as well as 19 CFR 
351.225(f) for further information on the 
scope inquiry procedures, including the 
timelines for the submission of 
comments. 
Please note that this notice of scope 
ruling applications filed in AD and CVD 
proceedings may be published before 
any potential initiation, or after the 
initiation, of a given scope inquiry 
based on a scope ruling application 
identified in this notice. Therefore, 
please refer to the case segment on 
ACCESS to determine whether a scope 
ruling application has been accepted or 
rejected and whether a scope inquiry 
has been initiated. 
Interested parties who wish to be 
served scope ruling applications for a 
particular AD or CVD order may file a 
request to be included on the annual 
inquiry service list during the 
anniversary month of the publication of 
the AD or CVD order in accordance with 
19 CFR 351.225(n) and Commerce’s

Determination of Industry Support for 
the Petitions 
Sections 702(b)(1) and 732(b)(1) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), 
require that a petition be filed by or on 
behalf of the domestic industry. To 
determine that the petition has been 
filed by or on behalf of the industry, 
sections 702(c)(4)(A) and 732(c)(4)(A) of 
the Act require that the domestic 
producers or workers who support the 
petition account for: (i) at least 25 
percent of the total production of the 
domestic like product; and (ii) more 
than 50 percent of the production of the 
domestic like product produced by that 
portion of the industry expressing 
support for, or opposition to, the 
petition. Moreover, sections 702(c)(4)(D) 
and 732(c)(4)(D) of the Act provide that, 
if the petition does not establish support 
of domestic producers or workers 
accounting for more than 50 percent of 
the total production of the domestic like 
product, Commerce shall: (i) poll the 
industry or rely on other information in 
order to determine if there is support for 
the petition, as required by 
subparagraph (A); or (ii) if there is a 
large number of producers, determine 
industry support using a statistically 
valid sampling method to poll the 
industry. 
Extension of Time 
Sections 702(c)(1)(A) and 732(c)(1)(A) 
of the Act provide that within 20 days 
of the filing of an antidumping or 
countervailing duty petition, Commerce 
will determine, inter alia, whether the 
petition has been filed by or on behalf 
of the U.S. industry producing the 
domestic like product. Sections 
702(c)(1)(B) and 732(c)(1)(B) of the Act 
provide that the deadline for the 
initiation determination, in exceptional 
circumstances, may be extended by 20 
days in any case in which Commerce 
must ‘‘poll or otherwise determine 
support for the petition by the 
industry.’’ Because it is not clear from 
the Petitions whether the industry 
support criteria have been met, 
Commerce has determined it should 
extend the time period for determining 
whether to initiate the investigations in 
order to further examine the issue of 
industry support. 
Commerce will need additional time 
to gather and analyze additional 
information regarding industry support. 
Therefore, it is necessary to extend the 
deadline for determining the adequacy 
of the Petitions by an additional 20 
days. As a result, in accordance with 
sections 702(c)(1)(B) and 732(c)(1)(B) of 
the Act, Commerce’s initiation 
determination will now be due no later 
than January 20, 2026.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 
Sections 101(a)(5)(A) and (D) of the 
MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.) direct 
the Secretary of Commerce to allow, 
upon request, the incidental, but not 
intentional, taking of small numbers of 
marine mammals by U.S. citizens who 
engage in a specified activity (other than 
commercial fishing) within a specified 
geographical region if certain findings 
are made and either regulations are 
issued or, if the taking is limited to 
harassment, a notice of a proposed 
authorization is provided to the public 
for review. 
An authorization for incidental 
takings shall be granted if NMFS finds 
that the taking will have a negligible 
impact on the species or stock(s), will 
not have an unmitigable adverse impact 
on the availability of the species or 
stock(s) for subsistence uses (where 
relevant), and if the permissible 
methods of taking and requirements 
pertaining to the mitigation, monitoring 
and reporting of such takings are set 
forth. NMFS has defined ‘‘negligible 
impact’’ in 50 CFR 216.103 as an impact 
resulting from the specified activity that 
cannot be reasonably expected to, and is 
not reasonably likely to, adversely affect 
the species or stock through effects on 
annual rates of recruitment or survival. 
Except with respect to certain 
activities not pertinent here, the MMPA 
defines ‘‘harassment’’ as: any act of 
pursuit, torment, or annoyance which (i) 
has the potential to injure a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild (Level A harassment); or (ii) has 
the potential to disturb a marine 
mammal or marine mammal stock in the 
wild by causing disruption of behavioral 
patterns, including, but not limited to, 
migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, 
feeding, or sheltering (Level B 
harassment). 
On January 19, 2021, we issued a final 
rule with regulations to govern the 
unintentional taking of marine 
mammals incidental to geophysical 
survey activities conducted by oil and 
gas industry operators, and those 
persons authorized to conduct activities 
on their behalf (collectively ‘‘industry 
operators’’), in U.S. waters of the GOA
1
 
over the course of 5 years (86 FR 5322, 
January 19, 2021). The rule was based 
on our findings that the total taking 
from the specified activities over the 5- 
year period will have a negligible 
impact on the affected species or 
stock(s) of marine mammals and will 
not have an unmitigable adverse impact 
on the availability of those species or 
stocks for subsistence uses, and became 
effective on April 19, 2021. 
The regulations at 50 CFR 217.180 et 
seq. allow for the issuance of LOAs to industry operators for the incidental 
take of marine mammals during 
geophysical survey activities and 
prescribe the permissible methods of 
taking and other means of effecting the 
least practicable adverse impact on 
marine mammal species or stocks and 
their habitat (often referred to as 
mitigation), as well as requirements 
pertaining to the monitoring and 
reporting of such taking. Under 50 CFR 
217.186(e), issuance of an LOA shall be 
based on a determination that the level 
of taking will be consistent with the 
findings made for the total taking 
allowable under these regulations and a 
determination that the amount of take 
authorized under the LOA is of no more 
than small numbers. 
NMFS subsequently discovered that 
the 2021 rule was based on erroneous 
take estimates. We conducted another 
rulemaking using correct take estimates 
and other newly available and pertinent 
information relevant to the analyses 
supporting some of the findings in the 
2021 final rule and the taking allowable 
under the regulations. We issued a final 
rule in April 2024 (89 FR 31488, April 
24, 2024), effective May 24, 2024, 
through April 19, 2026. 
The 2024 final rule made no changes 
to the specified activities or the 
specified geographical region in which 
those activities would be conducted, nor 
to the original 5-year period of 
effectiveness. In consideration of the 
new information, the 2024 rule 
presented new analyses supporting 
affirmance of the negligible impact 
determinations for all species, and 
affirmed that the existing regulations, 
which contain mitigation, monitoring, 
and reporting requirements, are 
consistent with the ‘‘least practicable 
adverse impact’’ standard of the MMPA. 
NMFS issued a LOA to WesternGeco 
on March 7, 2025, for the taking of 
marine mammals incidental to a three- 
dimensional ocean bottom node survey 
over 240 lease blocks in the Green 
Canyon and Walker Ridge areas, 
effective March 7, 2025, through 
December 31, 2025. Please see the 
Federal Register notice of issuance (90 
FR 11947, March 13, 2025) for 
additional detail regarding the LOA and 
the survey activity. 
On March 20, 2025, WesternGeco 
informed NMFS that they shifted the 
planned survey area westward and, 
accordingly, they requested a 
modification to the LOA to reflect this 
adjustment. The updated survey plan 
maintained a total of 100 days of sound 
source operation, with the distribution 
shifted to include 57 days in zone 7, 31 
days in zone 5, and 12 days in zone 6. 
Since the number of survey days per 
zone changed, we updated the take 
numbers accordingly based on this new 
information. There were no other 
changes to the planned survey. On 
March 31, 2025, NMFS issued a 
modified LOA to WesternGeco (90 FR 
14789, April 4, 2025). 
On November 18, 2025, WesternGeco 
notified NMFS that the survey 
commenced later than was originally 
planned (i.e., May/June instead of March), mainly due to vessel scheduling 
and availability constraints. 
WesternGeco requested that NMFS 
extend the end of the LOA effective 
period from December 31, 2025, to 
February 28, 2026, to provide sufficient 
time to complete the survey. To account 
for any potential additional delays, 
NMFS recommended extending the 
LOA effective period through April 19, 
2026 (i.e., the expiration date for the rule). The overall survey plan remains 
the same (i.e., 100 total days of sound source operation). However, given the 
survey timing now involves months for 
which take was not previously assessed, 
we have updated WesternGeco’s take 
estimates based on the revised schedule 
(table 1). The monthly distribution of 
survey days is not known in advance, 
though we assume that the planned 100 
days of source operation would occur 
contiguously. Take estimates for each 
species are based on the period that 
produces the greatest value. 
For the Rice’s whale, take estimates 
based on the modeling yielded results 
that are not realistically likely to occur 
when considered in light of other

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES252 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices relevant information concerning Rice’s 
whale habitat preferences considered 
during the rulemaking process. NMFS’ 
2024 final rule provided detailed 
discussion regarding Rice’s whale 
habitat (e.g., 89 FR 31508, 31519, April 24, 2024). In summary, recent survey 
data, sightings, and acoustic data 
support Rice’s whale occurrence in 
waters throughout the GOA between 
approximately 100 and 400 meters (m) 
depth along the continental shelf break, 
and associated habitat-based density 
modeling has identified similar habitat 
(i.e., approximately 100 to 400 m water depths along the continental shelf 
break) as being Rice’s whale habitat 
(Garrison et al., 2023; Soldevilla et al., 2022, 2024). 
Although Rice’s whales may occur 
outside of the general depth range 
expected to provide suitable habitat, we 
expect that any such occurrence would 
be rare. WesternGeco’s planned 
activities will occur in water depths of 
approximately 700 to 3,400 m in the 
central GOA. Thus, NMFS does not 
expect there to be the reasonable 
potential for take of Rice’s whale in 
association with this survey and, 
accordingly, does not authorize take of 
Rice’s whale through the LOA. 
Based on the results of our analysis, 
NMFS has determined that the level of 
taking expected for this survey and 
authorized through the LOA is 
consistent with the findings made for 
the total taking allowable under the 
regulations. See table 1 in this notice 
and table 6 of the rule (89 FR 31488, 
April 24, 2024). 
Small Numbers Determination 
Under the rule, NMFS may not 
authorize incidental take of marine 
mammals in an LOA if it will exceed 
‘‘small numbers.’’ In short, when an 
acceptable estimate of the individual 
marine mammals taken is available, if 
the estimated number of individual 
animals taken is up to, but not greater 
than, one-third of the best available 
abundance estimate, NMFS will 
determine that the numbers of marine 
mammals taken of a species or stock are 
small (89 FR 31535, May 24, 2024). For 
more information please see NMFS’ 
discussion of small numbers in the 2021 
final rule (86 FR 5438, January 19, 
2021). 
The take numbers for authorization 
are determined as described in the 
Federal Register notice of issuance (90 
FR 11947, March 13, 2025). 
Subsequently, the total incidents of 
harassment for each species are 
multiplied by scalar ratios to produce a 
derived product that better reflects the 
number of individuals likely to be taken 
within a survey (as compared to the 
total number of instances of take), 
accounting for the likelihood that some 
individual marine mammals may be 
taken on more than 1 day (86 FR 5404, 
January 19, 2021). The output of this 
scaling, where appropriate, is 
incorporated into adjusted total take 
estimates that are the basis for NMFS’ 
small numbers determinations, as 
depicted in table 1. 
This product is used by NMFS in 
making the necessary small numbers 
determinations through comparison 
with the best available abundance 
estimates (see discussion at 86 FR 5391, 
January 19, 2021). For this comparison, 
NMFS’ approach is to use the maximum 
theoretical population, determined 
through review of current stock 
assessment reports (SAR; https://
www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/ 
marine-mammal-protection/marine- 
mammal-stock-assessments) and model- 
predicted abundance information 
(https://seamap.env.duke.edu/models/ 
Duke/GOM). Information supporting the 
small numbers determinations is 
provided in table 1.

Best abundance estimate. For most taxa, the best abundance estimate for purposes of comparison with take estimates is considered here to

SAR abundance estimate is used.

Based on the analysis contained 
herein of WesternGeco’s proposed 
survey activity described in its LOA 
application and the anticipated take of 
marine mammals, NMFS finds that 
small numbers of marine mammals will 
be taken relative to the affected species 
or stock sizes (i.e., less than one-third of the best available abundance estimate); 
therefore, the taking is of no more than 
small numbers.

Year (FY) 2019 (Pub. L. 115–232), as 
amended by section 1011 of the NDAA 
for FY 2020 (Pub. L. 116–92). Section 
1006 applies to accounting firms that 
provide financial statement auditing to 
DoD in support of the audit under 31 
U.S.C. 3521 or audit remediation 
services in support of the Financial 
Improvement and Audit Remediation 
Plan described in 10 U.S.C. 240b. Such 
firms, when responding to a solicitation 
or awarded a contract for the acquisition 
of covered services, must disclose to 
DoD before any contract action 
(including award, renewals, and 
amendments) the details of any 
disciplinary proceedings with respect to 
the accounting firm or its associated 
persons before any entity with the 
authority to enforce compliance with 
rules or laws applying to audit services 
offered by the accounting firm. DoD, as 
a matter of policy to provide a level 
playing field between firms that provide 
audit services to support certain DoD 
audits, is extending this requirement to 
firms other than accounting firms that 
provide such services. Section 1011 
amended section 1006 to require any 
disclosures to be treated as confidential 
to the extent required by the court or 
agency in which the proceeding 
occurred and to be treated in a manner 
consistent with any protections or

Cyber Incident Reporting and Cloud 
Computing 
AGENCY: Defense Acquisition Regulations System; Department of 
Defense (DoD). 
ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: The Defense Acquisition Regulations System has submitted to 
OMB for clearance the following 
proposal for collection of information 
under the provisions of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act. 
DATES: DoD will consider all comments received by February 4, 2026. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Title and OMB Number: Safeguarding 
Covered Defense Information, Cyber 
Incident Reporting, and Cloud 
Computing; OMB Control Number 
0704–0478. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit and not-for-profit institutions. 
Respondent’s Obligation: Required to 
obtain or retain benefits. 
Reporting Frequency: On occasion. 
Number of Respondents: 1,971. 
Responses per Respondent: 8.2, 
approximately. 
Annual Responses: 16,223. 
Average Burden per Response: 0.42 
hours. 
Annual Burden Hours: 6,770. 
Needs and Uses: Offerors and 
contractors must report cyber incidents 
on unclassified networks or information 
systems, within cloud computing 
services, and when they affect 
contractors designated as providing 
operationally critical support, as 
required by statute. 
a. The clause at DFARS 252.204– 
7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense 
Information and Cyber Incident 
Reporting, covers cyber incident 
reporting requirements for incidents 
that affect a covered contractor 
information system or the covered 
defense information residing therein, or 
that affects the contractor’s ability to 
perform the requirements of the contract 
that are designated as operationally 
critical support and identified in the 
contract. 
b. The provision at DFARS 252.204– 
7008, Compliance with Safeguarding 
Covered Defense Information Controls, 
requires an offeror that proposes to vary

of how the specified security control is 
not applicable or an alternative control 
or protective measure is used to achieve 
equivalent protection. 
c. The provision at DFARS 252.239– 
7009, Representation of Use of Cloud 
Computing, requires offerors to report 
that they ‘‘anticipate’’ or ‘‘do not 
anticipate’’ utilizing cloud computing

7010 clause of the contract. 
d. The clause at DFARS 252.239– 
7010, Cloud Computing Services, 
requires reporting of cyber incidents 
that occur when DoD is purchasing 
cloud computing services. 
These DFARS provisions and clauses 
facilitate mandatory cyber incident 
reporting requirements in accordance 
with statutory regulations. When reports 
are submitted, DoD will analyze the 
reported information for cyber threats 
and vulnerabilities in order to develop 
response measures as well as improve 
U.S. Government understanding of 
advanced cyber threat activity. In 
addition, the security requirements in 
NIST SP 800–171 are specifically 
tailored for use in protecting sensitive 
information residing in contractor 
information systems and generally 
reduce the burden placed on contractors 
by eliminating Federal-centric processes 
and requirements. The information 
provided will inform DoD in assessing 
the overall risk to DoD covered defense 
information on unclassified contractor 
systems and networks. 
Comments and recommendations on 
the proposed information collection 
should be sent to Ms. Susan Minson, 
DoD Desk Officer, at Oira_submission@omb.eop.gov. Please identify the proposed information collection by DoD 
Desk Officer and the Docket ID number

Federal Acquisition Regulation 
Supplement (DFARS) Part 228, Bonds 
and Insurance, and related clauses at 
252.228; OMB Control Number 0704– 
0216. 
Type of Request: Extension of a 
currently approved collection. 
Affected Public: Businesses or other 
for-profit and not-for-profit institutions. 
Respondent’s Obligation: Required to 
obtain or retain benefits. 
Frequency: On Occasion. Number of Respondents: 385. 
Responses per Respondent: 1. 
Annual Responses: 385. 
Average Burden per Response: 
Approximately 1.57 hours. 
Annual Burden Hours: 603. 
Needs and Uses: DoD uses the 
information obtained through this 
collection to determine (1) the 
allowability of a contractor’s costs of 
providing war-hazard benefits to its 
employees; (2) the need for an 
investigation regarding an accident that 
occurs in connection with a contract; 
and (3) whether a non-Spanish 
contractor performing a service or 
construction contract in Spain has 
adequate insurance coverage. DFARS 
252.228–7000, Reimbursement for War- 
Hazard Losses, requires the contractor to 
provide notice and supporting 
documentation to the contracting officer 
regarding potential claims, open claims, 
and settlements providing war-hazard 
benefits to contractor employees. 
DFARS 252.228–7005, Accident 
Reporting and Investigation Involving 
Aircraft, Missiles, and Space Launch 
Vehicles, requires the contractor to 
report promptly to the administrative 
contracting officer all pertinent facts 
relating to each accident involving an 
aircraft, missile, or space launch vehicle 
being manufactured, modified, repaired, 
or overhauled in connection with the 
contract. DFARS 252.228–7006, 
Compliance with Spanish Laws and 
Insurance, requires the contractor to 
provide the contracting officer with a 
written representation that the 
contractor has obtained the required 
types of insurance in the minimum 
amounts specified in the clause, when 
performing a service or construction 
contract in Spain.

Pursuant to section 157.9 of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure,
1
within 90 days of this 
Notice the Commission staff will either: 
complete its environmental review and 
place it into the Commission’s public 
record (eLibrary) for this proceeding; or 
issue a Notice of Schedule for 
Environmental Review. If a Notice of 
Schedule for Environmental Review is 
issued, it will indicate, among other 
milestones, the anticipated date for the 
Commission staff’s issuance of the final 
environmental impact statement (FEIS) 
or environmental assessment (EA) for 
this proposal. The filing of an EA in the 
Commission’s public record for this 
proceeding or the issuance of a Notice 
of Schedule for Environmental Review 
will serve to notify federal and state

completion of all necessary reviews, and 
the subsequent need to complete all 
federal authorizations within 90 days of 
the date of issuance of the Commission 
staff’s FEIS or EA. 
Public Participation 
There are three ways to become 
involved in the Commission’s review of 
this project: you can file comments on 
the project, you can protest the filing, 
and you can file a motion to intervene 
in the proceeding. There is no fee or 
cost for filing comments or intervening. 
The deadline for filing a motion to 
intervene is 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 20, 2026. How to file protests, 
motions to intervene, and comments is 
explained below. 
For public inquiries and assistance 
with making filings such as 
interventions, comments, or requests for 
rehearing, contact the Office of Public 
Participation (OPP) at (202) 502–6595 or 
OPP@ferc.gov. 
Comments 
Any person wishing to comment on 
the project may do so. Comments may 
include statements of support or 
objections, to the project as a whole or 
specific aspects of the project. The more 
specific your comments, the more useful 
they will be. 
Protests 
Pursuant to sections 157.10(a)(4)
2
and 
385.211
3
of the Commission’s 
regulations under the NGA, any person
4
 
may file a protest to the application. 
Protests must comply with the 
requirements specified in section 
385.2001
5
of the Commission’s 
regulations. A protest may also serve as 
a motion to intervene so long as the 
protestor states it also seeks to be an 
intervenor. 
To ensure that your comments or 
protests are timely and properly 
recorded, please submit your comments 
on or before 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on 
January 20, 2026. 
There are three methods you can use 
to submit your comments or protests to 
the Commission. In all instances, please 
reference the Project docket number 
CP26–53–000 in your submission. 
(1) You may file your comments 
electronically by using the eComment 
feature, which is located on the 
Commission’s website at www.ferc.gov 
under the link to Documents and 
Filings. Using eComment is an easy 
method for interested persons to submit 
brief, text-only comments on a project; 
(2) You may file your comments or 
protests electronically by using the 
eFiling feature, which is located on the 
Commission’s website (www.ferc.gov) 
under the link to Documents and 
Filings. With eFiling, you can provide 
comments in a variety of formats by 
attaching them as a file with your 
submission. New eFiling users must 
first create an account by clicking on 
‘‘eRegister.’’ You will be asked to select 
the type of filing you are making; first 
select ‘‘General’’ and then select 
‘‘Comment on a Filing’’; or 
(3) You can file a paper copy of your 
comments or protests by mailing them 
to the following address below. Your 
written comments must reference the 
Project docket number (CP26–53–000). 
To file via USPS: Debbie-Anne A. 
Reese, Secretary, Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street

The Commission encourages 
electronic filing of comments (options 1 
and 2 above) and has eFiling staff 
available to assist you at (202) 502–8258 
or FercOnlineSupport@ferc.gov. Persons who comment on the 
environmental review of this project 
will be placed on the Commission’s 
environmental mailing list, and will 
receive notification when the 
environmental documents (EA or EIS) 
are issued for this project and will be 
notified of meetings associated with the 
Commission’s environmental review 
process. 
The Commission considers all 
comments received about the project in 
determining the appropriate action to be 
taken. However, the filing of a comment 
alone will not serve to make the filer a 
party to the proceeding. To become a 
party, you must intervene in the 
proceeding. For instructions on how to 
intervene, see below. 
Interventions 
Any person, which includes 
individuals, organizations, businesses, 
municipalities, and other entities,
6
has 
the option to file a motion to intervene 
in this proceeding. Only intervenors 
have the right to request rehearing of 
Commission orders issued in this 
proceeding and to subsequently 
challenge the Commission’s orders in 
the U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal. 
To intervene, you must submit a 
motion to intervene to the Commission 
in accordance with Rule 214 of the 
Commission’s Rules of Practice and 
Procedure
7
and the regulations under 
the NGA
8
by the intervention deadline 
for the project, which is 5:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time on January 20, 2026. As 
described further in Rule 214, your 
motion to intervene must state, to the 
extent known, your position regarding 
the proceeding, as well as your interest 
in the proceeding. For an individual, 
this could include your status as a 
landowner, ratepayer, resident of an 
impacted community, or recreationist. 
You do not need to have property 
directly impacted by the project in order 
to intervene. For more information 
about motions to intervene, refer to the 
FERC website at https://www.ferc.gov/ 
resources/guides/how-to/intervene.asp. 
There are two ways to submit your 
motion to intervene. In both instances, 
please reference the Project docket 
number CP26–53–000 in your 
submission.

All timely, unopposed
9
motions to

operation of Rule 214(c)(1).
10
Motions to 
intervene that are filed after the 
intervention deadline are untimely, and 
may be denied. Any late-filed motion to 
intervene must show good cause for 
being late and must explain why the 
time limitation should be waived and 
provide justification by reference to 
factors set forth in Rule 214(d) of the 
Commission’s Rules and Regulations.
11
 
A person obtaining party status will be 
placed on the service list maintained by 
the Secretary of the Commission and

A. Does this action apply to me? 
This action is directed to the public 
in general and may be of particular 
interest to those involved in the 
manufacture (defined under TSCA 
section 3(9) to include import), 
processing, distribution, use, and 
disposal of 1,3-butadiene, related 
industry trade organizations, non- 
governmental organizations with an 
interest in human and environmental 
health, State and local governments, 
Tribal Nations, and/or those interested 
in the assessment of risks involving 
chemical substances and mixtures 
regulated under TSCA. As such, the 
Agency has not attempted to describe all 
the specific entities that this action 
might apply to. If you need help 
determining applicability, consult the 
technical contact listed under 
FOR 
FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 
B. What is the Agency’s authority for 
taking this action? 
The Agency conducted this risk 
evaluation under TSCA section 6, (15 
U.S.C. 2605), which requires that EPA 
conduct risk evaluations on chemical 
substances and identifies the minimum 
components EPA must include in the 
risk evaluations. Each risk evaluation 
must be conducted consistent with the 
best available science, be based on the 
weight of the scientific evidence, and 
consider reasonably available 
information, and not consider costs or 
non-risk factors. 15 U.S.C. 2625(h), (i), 
and (k). See also the implementing 
procedural regulations at 40 CFR part 
702 and for more information about the 
TSCA risk evaluation process for 
existing chemicals, go to https://
www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing- 
chemicals-under-tsca. 
C. What action is the Agency taking? 
EPA is announcing the availability of 
the final risk evaluation under TSCA for 
1,3-butadiene. The purpose of risk 
evaluations under TSCA is to determine 
whether a chemical substance presents 
an unreasonable risk of injury to health 
or the environment under the 
conditions of use, including 
unreasonable risk to potentially exposed 
or susceptible subpopulations identified 
as relevant to the risk evaluation by 
EPA, and without consideration of costs 
or non-risk factors. EPA has used the 
best available science to prepare this 
final risk evaluation and ensured that 
this action is consistent with Executive 
Order 14303 ‘‘Restoring Gold Standard 
Science,’’ (May 23, 2025). Based on the 
weight of scientific evidence, the 
Agency determined that 1,3-butadiene 
poses unreasonable risk to human 
health driven by specific conditions of 
use. EPA will now initiate risk 
management action as required 
pursuant to TSCA section 6(a) (15 U.S.C 
2605(a)), to address the unreasonable 
risk. 
II. Background 
A. What is 1,3-butadiene? 
1,3-Butadiene is a colorless gas with 
a total production volume (PV) in the 
United States between 1 and 5 billion 
pounds. 1,3-Butadiene is produced from 
petrochemical processing and is also 
used to aid in petrochemical 
manufacturing but is primarily used as 
a monomer to produce plastic and 
rubber products. This involves 
polymerization of 1,3-butadiene with 
itself or with other monomers, which 
are then incorporated into various 
rubber and plastic articles. These 
synthetic rubbers, resins, and latex are 
used to manufacture tires, other rubber 
components and plastic materials. 1,3- 
Butadiene polymers are also used as 
viscosity agents in several formulations 
for adhesives, lubricants, and paints and 
coatings. These polymerization products 
which are polymeric forms of 1,3- 
butadiene are also referred to as 1,3- 
butadiene by some chemical safety data 
sheets (SDSs). This risk assessment 
covers only the monomer form of 1,3- 
butadiene. 
B. Summary of Activities for the Risk 
Evaluation of 1,3-Butadiene 
On December 30, 2019, EPA 
announced its designation of 1,3- 
butadiene as a high priority substance 
for risk evaluation under TSCA (84 FR 
71924 (FRL–10003–15)). On April 9, 
2020, EPA sought public comment on 
the draft scope of the 1,3-butadiene risk 
evaluation (85 FR 19941(FRL–10007– 
11)) and, after considering public 
comments, issued the final scope on 
September 4, 2020 (85 FR 55281 (FRL– 
10013–90)). On December 3, 2024, EPA 
released the draft risk evaluation for 
public comment and external peer 
review by the Science Advisory 
Committee on Chemicals (SACC) (89 FR 
95779 (FRL–12241–02–OCSPP)). 
These documents, other supporting 
documents, and public comments are in 
dockets EPA–HQ–OPPT–2018–0451 and 
EPA–HQ–OPPT–2024–0425. The 
following documents are being released 
with this notice:

documents. 
III. Unreasonable Risk Determination 
EPA has determined that 1,3- 
butadiene, under the conditions of use 
(COUs), presents an unreasonable risk of 
injury to human health. EPA has 
determined that the unreasonable risk to 
human health presented by 1,3- 
butadiene is driven by 11 of the 30 
COUs. The 11 COUs that significantly 
contribute to the unreasonable risk 
determination for 1,3-butadiene are 
based on identified non-cancer and 
cancer risk to workers, including 1 COU 
that contributes to unreasonable risk of 
injury to occupational non-users, from 
inhalation exposure: 
€Manufacturing—domestic manufacturing; 
€Manufacturing—importing; €Processing as a reactant— intermediate (adhesive manufacturing; 
all other basic organic chemical 
manufacturing; fuel binder for solid 
rocket fuels; organic fiber 
manufacturing; petrochemical 
manufacturing; plastic material and 
resin manufacturing; propellant 
manufacturing; synthetic rubber 
manufacturing; paint and coating 
manufacturing); 
€Processing as a reactant—monomer used in polymerization process 
(Synthetic rubber manufacturing; plastic 
material and resin manufacturing); 
€Processing—incorporation into formulation, mixture, or reaction 
product—monomers (plastic product 
manufacturing; plastic material and 
resin manufacturing; synthetic rubber 
manufacturing); 
€Processing—incorporation into formulation, mixture, or reaction 
product—plasticizer (asphalt paving, 
roofing, and coating materials 
manufacturing); 
€Processing—incorporation into article—monomer (rubber product 
manufacturing); 
€Processing—use-non-incorporative activities—fuel (petroleum refineries); 
€Processing—repackaging— (wholesale and retail trade fuel; 
synthetic rubber manufacturing; 
petrochemical manufacturing); 
€Processing—recycling; and €Disposal. IV. Next Step Is Risk Management 
Consistent with TSCA section 6(a), 
EPA will propose a risk management

The CA–GDF General Permit was issued by the 
EPA under the Tribal Minor NSR Program on May 
1, 2019, and the permit became effective June 12, 
2019. 84 FR 20879 (May 13, 2019). This permit is 
available on https://www.regulations.gov under Docket ID EPA–R09–OAR–2016–0580.

On July 31, 2025, the EPA issued a minor NSR 
permit to Agua Caliente Fuel Rancho Mirage 
(formerly the Agua Caliente Tribal Corporation 
Gasoline Dispensing Facility). This permit allows 
for increased fuel throughout at Agua Caliente Fuel 
Rancho Mirage. As a result, Agua Caliente Fuel 
Rancho Mirage no longer qualifies for coverage 
under the CA–GDF General Permit. See Docket ID 
EPA–R09–OAR–2024–0455 at https://
www.regulations.gov.

On May 31, 2022, the EPA issued an amended 
approval to the Soboba Economic Development 
Corporation’s Request for Coverage for Roadrunner 
Express (formerly the Soboba Economic 
Development Corporation Gasoline Dispensing 
Facility), submitted on February 10, 2022 
(Application #2022–004–AA). See Docket ID EPA–

regulatory action, to the extent 
necessary, so that 1,3-butadiene no 
longer presents an unreasonable risk. 
EPA expects to focus its risk 
management action on the conditions of 
use that significantly contribute to the 
unreasonable risk. In proposing a rule 
and selecting among requirements, 
consistent with TSCA section 6(c)(2), 
EPA will consider and factor in, to the 
extent practicable: (i) the effects of 1,3- 
butadiene on health and the 
environment, (ii) the magnitude of 
exposure to 1,3-butadiene of human 
beings and the environment, (iii) the 
benefits of 1,3-butadiene for various 
uses, and (iv) the reasonably 
ascertainable economic consequences of 
the rule. Additional information 
received may inform the risk 
management of 1,3-butadiene and, like 
the prioritization and risk evaluation 
processes, there will be opportunity for 
public comment on any proposed risk 
management actions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Executive Summary 
A. Does this action apply to me? 
This action provides information that 
is directed to the public in general. 
B. What is the Agency’s authority for 
taking this action? 
EPA is publishing this document in 
the Federal Register as required by sections 5 of the Toxic Substances 
Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2601 et 
seq., and corresponding EPA regulations. 
Under TSCA, a chemical substance 
may be either an ‘‘existing’’ chemical 
substance or a ‘‘new’’ chemical 
substance, see https://www.epa.gov/ 
chemicals-under-tsca. Any chemical substance that is not on EPA’s TSCA 
Inventory of Chemical Substances 
(TSCA Inventory) is classified as a ‘‘new 
chemical substance,’’ while a chemical 
substance that is listed on the TSCA 
Inventory is classified as an ‘‘existing 
chemical substance.’’ See TSCA section 
3(2) and (11). For more information 
about the TSCA Inventory, see https:// 
www.epa.gov/inventory. 
Any person who intends to 
manufacture (including import) a new 
chemical substance for a non-exempt 
commercial purpose, or to manufacture 
or process a chemical substance in a 
non-exempt manner for a use that EPA 
has determined is a significant new use, 
is required by TSCA section 5 to 
provide EPA with a PMN, MCAN, or 
SNUN, as appropriate, before initiating 
the activity. EPA will review the notice, 
make a risk determination on the new 
chemical substance or significant new 
use, and take appropriate action as 
described in TSCA section 5(a)(3). 
TSCA section 5(h)(1) authorizes EPA 
to allow persons, upon application and 
under appropriate restrictions, to 
manufacture a new chemical substance, 
or manufacture or process a chemical 
substance subject to a significant new 
use rule (SNUR) issued under TSCA

purposes, upon a showing that the 
manufacture, processing, distribution in 
commerce, use, and disposal of the 
chemical substances will not present an 
unreasonable risk of injury to health or 
the environment. This is referred to as 
a test marketing exemption, or TME. 
Premanufacture notification 
procedures for review of certain new 
microbial products of biotechnology are 
established in 40 CFR part 725. These 
pertain to MCANs and biotechnology 
exemptions, including TSCA 
experimental release applications 
(TERAs), TMEs for microorganisms, and 
Tier I and Tier II exemptions. 
C. What action is the Agency taking? 
This document provides notice of 
receipt and status reports for the 
covered period and certain submissions 
under TSCA section 5 and provides an 
opportunity to comment on this 
information. The Agency is providing 
information about the receipt of PMNs, 
SNUNs, MCANs, and amendments to a 
previously submitted notice; test 
information; biotechnology exemption 
applications under 40 CFR part 725; 
TME applications; NOCs for new 
chemical substances; and a periodic 
status report on chemical substances 
that are currently under EPA review or 
have recently concluded review. 
D. What should I consider as I prepare 
my comments for EPA? 
1. Submitting CBI. Do not submit CBI to EPA through https://
www.regulations.gov or email. If you wish to include CBI in your comment, 
please follow the instructions at https:// 
www.epa.gov/dockets/commenting-epa-

Pesticides; Draft Guidance for 
Pesticide Registrants on Notifications, 
Non-Notifications, and Minor 
Formulation Amendments 
AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 
ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) is announcing 
the availability of and seeking public 
comment on a draft Pesticide 
Registration Notice (PR Notice) entitled 
‘‘Pesticide Registration (PR) Notice 
2026–NEW: Notifications, Non- 
Notifications, and Minor Formulation 
Amendments.’’ PR Notices are issued by 
the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) 
to inform pesticide registrants and other 
interested persons about important 
policies, procedures, and registration 
related decisions, and serve to provide 
guidance to pesticide registrants and 
OPP personnel. This draft PR Notice, 
when final, will supersede PR Notice 
98–10, entitled ‘‘Notifications, Non- 
notifications and Minor Formulation 
Amendments’’ dated October 22, 1998, 
in its entirety. In addition, the guidance 
in this draft PR Notice allowing for 
additions, modifications, or deletions of 
mandatory or advisory statements will 
supersede the contrary guidance in 
section II of PR Notice 2000–5, dated 
May 10, 2000, that requires such 
changes be submitted by amendment. 
EPA believes these changes align with 
Pillar 1 (‘‘Clean Air, Land, and Water for 
Every American’’) and Pillar 3 
(‘‘Permitting Reform’’) of the five pillars 
underpinning the Administrator’s 
‘‘Powering the Great American 
Comeback’’ initiative as these changes 
will improve submissions and save 
registrants and OPP time and resources, 
while maintaining full protection of 
human health and the environment. 
DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 19, 2026. 
ADDRESSES: Submit your comments, identified by docket identification (ID) 
number EPA–HQ–OPP–2025–2863,

Follow the online instructions for 
submitting comments. Do not submit 
electronically any information you 
consider to be Confidential Business 
Information (CBI) or other information 
whose disclosure is restricted by statute.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. General Information 
A. Does this action apply to me? 
This action is directed to the public 
in general. Although this action may be 
of particular interest to applicants 
seeking to amend their pesticide 
registration. Since other entities may 
also be interested, the Agency has not 
attempted to describe all the specific 
entities that may be affected by this 
action. 
B. What should I consider as I prepare 
my comments for EPA? 
1. Submitting CBI. Do not submit this information to EPA through 
regulations.gov or email. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that 
you claim to be CBI. For CBI 
information in a disk or CD–ROM that 
you mail to EPA, mark the outside of the 
disk or CD–ROM as CBI and then 
identify electronically within the disk or 
CD–ROM the specific information that 
is claimed as CBI. In addition to one 
complete version of the comment that 
includes information claimed as CBI, a 
copy of the comment that does not 
contain the information claimed as CBI 
must be submitted for inclusion in the 
public docket. Information so marked 
will not be disclosed except in 
accordance with procedures set forth in 
40 CFR part 2. 
2. Tips for preparing your comments. When preparing and submitting your 
comments, see the commenting tips at 
http://www.epa.gov/dockets/ 
comments.html. 
C. How can I get copies of this 
document and other related 
information? 
A copy of the draft PR notice is 
available in the docket under docket 
identification (ID) number EPA–HQ– 
OPP–2025–2863. 
II. What guidance does this PR Notice 
provide? 
This draft PR Notice provides updated 
guidance to registrants and applicants 
(both of which are referred to in this 
notice as ‘‘registrants’’) concerning the 
process for notifications, non- 
notifications and minor formulation 
amendments. This proposed notice 
updates and clarifies the scope of 
changes accepted by notification, non- 
notification and minor formulation 
amendment for all pesticide products.

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES272 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices This PR Notice, when final, will 
supersede PR Notice 98–10, entitled 
‘‘Notification, Non-notification, Minor 
Formulation Amendments’’ dated 
October 22, 1998, in its entirety. In 
addition, the guidance in this draft PR 
Notice allowing for additions, 
modifications, or deletions of 
mandatory or advisory statements will 
supersede the contrary guidance in 
section II of PR Notice 2000–5, dated 
May 10, 2000, that requires such 
changes be submitted by amendment. 
The changes in procedure presented 
in this draft PR Notice are updates to 
clarify the scope of all registration 
changes accepted by notification, non- 
notification, and minor formation 
amendment for all pesticide products. 
The draft PR Notice adds several new 
minor modifications, moves some 
existing minor modifications to a more 
streamlined process (e.g., from notification to non-notification), and 
provides more details in the minor 
modification and process descriptions 
to enhance clarity. For example, a new 
minor modification in the draft PR 
Notice includes the use of placeholder 
text for certain symbols, pictures, logos, 
and graphics, including distributor 
product logos, which can be added to 
the master label via notification and 
then, once the placeholder text is on the 
stamped master label, the actual 
symbols, pictures, logos, or graphics can 
be added to the master label via non- 
notification. These changes will help 
reduce the burden associated with 
completing, submitting and processing 
these applications for both pesticide 
registrants and the Agency and provide 
improved efficiencies without the extra 
burden. 
EPA is particularly interested in 
receiving feedback on the following 
proposed changes in the draft PR 
Notice: updated requirements under 
Section II.E, which refers to symbols, 
pictures, logos, and graphics or 
placeholder text for symbols, pictures, 
logos, and graphics being added to the 
master label by notification; use of a 
placeholder for adding state-required 
fertilizer restrictions; specific 100% 
repack product label revisions; the 
addition of referral statements and 
marketing claims; and changes to 
sources for certain inert ingredients, 
addition of certain product packaging 
graphics and statements, changes in 
state registration status, changes in 
warranty statement, and adjustments to 
certain Endangered Species Act (ESA)- 
related labeling language that are now 
being proposed to be made via non- 
notification. 
III. Do PR Notices contain binding 
requirements? 
No, the draft PR Notice discussed in 
this document is intended to provide 
guidance to EPA personnel and decision 
makers and to pesticide registrants. 
While the requirements in the statutes 
and Agency regulations are binding on 
EPA and the applicants, this PR Notice, 
when final would not be binding on 
either EPA or pesticide registrants, and 
EPA may depart from the guidance 
where circumstances warrant and 
without prior notice. Likewise, pesticide 
registrants may assert that the guidance 
is not appropriate generally or not 
applicable to a specific pesticide or 
situation. 
IV. Statutory and Executive Order 
Reviews 
Additional information about these 
statutes and Executive Orders can be

regulations/laws-and-executive-orders. 
A. Executive Order 12866: Regulatory 
Planning and Review and Executive 
Order 13563: Improving Regulation and 
Regulatory Review 
This action is not a significant 
regulatory action under Executive Order 
12866 (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) 
and was therefore not submitted to the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) for review under Executive 
Orders 12866 and 13563 (76 FR 3821, 
January 21, 2011). 
B. Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) 
This guidance does not create any 
paperwork burdens that require 
additional approval by OMB under the 
PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. The 
information collection activities 
associated with pesticide registration 
are already approved by OMB under 
OMB Control No. 2070–0226, entitled 
‘‘Consolidated Pesticide Registration 
Submission Portal’’ (EPA ICR No. 2624).

document presents statements of 
findings made by EPA during the 
applicable period. 
C. What is the Agency’s authority for 
taking this action? 
TSCA section 5(a)(3) requires EPA to 
review a submission under TSCA 
section 5(a) and make specific findings 
pertaining to whether the substance may 
present unreasonable risk of injury to 
health or the environment. Among those 
potential findings is that the chemical 
substance or significant new use is not 
likely to present an unreasonable risk of 
injury to health or the environment per 
TSCA Section 5(a)(3)(C). 
TSCA section 5(g) requires EPA to 
publish in the Federal Register a 
statement of its findings after its review 
of a submission under TSCA section 
5(a) when EPA makes a finding that a 
new chemical substance or significant 
new use is not likely to present an 
unreasonable risk of injury to health or 
the environment. Such statements apply 
to PMNs, MCANs, and SNUNs 
submitted to EPA under TSCA section 
5. 
Anyone who plans to manufacture 
(which includes import) a new chemical 
substance for a non-exempt commercial 
purpose and any manufacturer or 
processor wishing to engage in a use of 
a chemical substance designated by EPA 
as a significant new use must submit a 
notice to EPA at least 90 days before 
commencing manufacture of the new 
chemical substance or before engaging 
in the significant new use. 
The submitter of a notice to EPA for 
which EPA has made a finding of ‘‘not 
likely to present an unreasonable risk of 
injury to health or the environment’’ 
may commence manufacture of the 
chemical substance or manufacture or 
processing for the significant new use 
notwithstanding any remaining portion 
of the applicable review period. 
II. Statements of Findings Under TSCA 
Section 5(a)(3)(C) 
In this unit, EPA identifies the PMNs, 
MCANs and SNUNs for which EPA has 
made findings under TSCA section 
5(a)(3)(C) that the new chemical 
substances or significant new uses are 
not likely to present an unreasonable 
risk of injury to health or the 
environment. For the findings made 
during this period, the following list

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES274 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices B. What is the Agency’s authority for 
taking this action? 
EPA is issuing this guidance pursuant 
to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, 
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 
136a, et seq.). II. What guidance does this PR Notice 
provide? 
The Agency is announcing the 
availability of a draft PR Notice entitled 
‘‘Process to Become an EPA Qualified 
Conservation Program (QCP) and 
Qualified External Party (QEP).’’ PR 
Notices are issued by OPP to inform 
pesticide registrants and other 
interested persons about important 
policies, procedures, and registration 
related decisions, and serve to provide 
guidance to pesticide registrants and 
OPP personnel. EPA is announcing the 
availability of and seeking public 
comment on this draft PR Notice. 
This draft PR Notice seeks to inform 
interested parties of (1) the proposed 
process of becoming an EPA QCP or 
EPA QEP and to solicit public comment 
on the proposed process, and (2) 
communicate the estimated paperwork 
burden that this process would create 
for the public and to solicit public 
comment on these estimates pursuant to 
the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
For this draft PR Notice, interested 
parties primarily include conservation 
programs, growers and other members 
of the agricultural community who 
support or consult growers when 
utilizing pesticides. 
III. What type of feedback is the EPA 
soliciting? 
EPA seeks comment on the following: 
A. How can EPA improve its proposed 
process to review and approve QCPs 
and QEPs? 
€The EPA would like feedback on the two applications described in the 
draft PR Notice. Specifically, are the 
instructions and questions in the 
applications clear? If not, please feel 
free to provide suggestions of how to 
clarify the instructions or questions. 
€Do any questions appear redundant or otherwise unnecessary for EPA to 
judge the quality of the program or 
organization/individual? 
€The Agency is considering expanding this process to also qualify 
conservation programs and external 
parties that support non-agricultural 
(e.g., turf, nursery/ornamentals, forestry, rights of way) uses. Additionally, the 
EPA intends to develop a mitigation 
menu for non-agricultural uses. 
However, this menu has not yet been 
developed. Are there conservation 
programs that cover non-agricultural use 
sites that could want to be qualified? 
Would there be value to qualify external 
parties for non-agricultural use sites? If 
yes to either of these questions, would 
the applications in their current form be 
relevant for these programs or parties 
seeking qualification? 
€Is there other or additional information that EPA should request to 
judge the program? 
B. What information on the burden 
estimates associated with completion of 
the application can stakeholders 
provide? 
€What amount of time would it take you or staff members in your 
organization to complete the application 
(please assign number of hours for each 
staff level involved—manager type, 
technical type and clerical type)? 
€EPA has estimated the burden to complete these applications to be 56 
hours total time, see Information 
Collection Request Supporting 
Statement for more details of this 
estimate. If your estimate is significantly 
different from this estimate, please 
explain why yours is different and if 
you anticipate your estimate is more 
likely to represent the typical entity 
who may apply or not. 
C. What types of information can 
stakeholders provide for EPA to 
anticipate the level of interest to better 
plan for resource requirements? 
€How many programs/organizations/ individuals provide these services in 
your area? Please provide separate 
estimates for each group. 
€Given the burden that it would take to complete the applications, how likely 
is it that you or your program 
organization will apply to become an 
QCP or QEP? 
€Do you think other organizations/ individuals like yours would find it 
worth the effort to also apply? 
D. How can the Agency implement 
programs be subject to a re-review 
process on a 5-year cycle? Additionally, 
if any elements of the program changes 
at any point the Agency proposes that 
the program or organization/individual 
is responsible for notifying EPA. 
€Please provide comments on the proposed re-review process. Should it 
occur? Is the process as described clear? 
€Is 5-years an appropriate length of time for approvals to remain valid? If 
not, what time frame would be more 
appropriate for a re-review process and 
why? 
E. How can the Agency’s proposed 
process revoke qualifying status if a 
QCP or QEP if it is found to be operating 
in a manner that does not align with 
Agency expectations or in line with the 
information previously submitted in its 
application? 
€Please comment on the proposed process to revoke status as QCP and 
QEP? Are there additional elements the 
Agency should consider? 
€The Agency would like to receive detailed input as to the extent states 
should be involved in any element of 
the proposed process. 
€What elements of the process should the states be included and why? 
If they should be included, please 
estimate how much time would be 
involved in reviewing or helping to 
prepare applications for the associated 
paperwork burden to account for state 
involvement. 
IV. Do PR Notices contain binding 
requirements? 
The requirements in the relevant 
statutes and Agency regulations may be 
binding, however, this PR Notice is not 
binding on either EPA or potential QCP 
or QEP applicants. The EPA may depart 
from the process where circumstances 
warrant and without prior notice. 
Likewise, relevant stakeholders may 
assert that the process is not appropriate 
generally or not applicable to their work 
or situation. 
V. Are these forms approved under the 
Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)? 
According to the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
et seq., an agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to 
respond to a collection of information 
that requires approval under the PRA, 
unless it has been approved by the 
Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) and displays a currently valid 
OMB control number. The information 
collection activities described in this 
draft PR Notice are being addressed in 
the new ICR entitled ‘‘Process to 
Become an EPA Qualified Conservation 
Program (QCP) and Qualified External 
Party (QEP),’’ identified as EPA ICR No. 
7807.01, that is included in the docket 
for public review and comment. EPA 
welcomes comment and will review 
public comments received on all 
materials including (1) the ICR 
(including public estimates of burden), 
(2) the draft PR Notice, and (3) the two 
applications. EPA will consider all 
public comments received and update 
all materials as appropriate for a second 
public review and comment period. 
After the second comment period, the 
Agency will provide a summary

2. Nominations 
Nominees should be scientific experts 
who have sufficient professional 
qualifications, including training and 
experience, to be capable of providing 
expert comments on the scientific issues 
for these reviews. Each nomination 
should include the following 
information: 
€Contact information for the person making the nomination; 
€Name, affiliation, and contact information for the nominee; and 
€The disciplinary and specific areas of expertise of the nominee. 
Submit your nomination as directed 
under 
ADDRESSESby the deadline 
indicated under 
DATES. 
Those who are selected from the pool 
of prospective candidates will be 
invited to attend a public SACC meeting 
and participate in the discussion of key 
issues and assumptions. In addition, 
they will be asked to review and to help 
finalize the meeting minutes and final 
report. 
SACC members and ad hoc reviewers 
are subject to the provisions of the 
Standards of Ethical Conduct for 
Employees of the Executive Branch at 5 
CFR part 2635, conflict of interest 
statutes in Title 18 of the United States 
Code and related regulations. In 
anticipation of this requirement, 
prospective candidates for service on 
the SACC will be asked to submit 
confidential financial information 
which shall fully disclose, among other 
financial interests, the candidate’s 
employment, stocks, and bonds, and 
where applicable, sources of research 
support. EPA will evaluate the 
candidates’ financial disclosure forms to 
assess whether there are financial 
conflicts of interest, appearance of a loss 
of impartiality, or any prior involvement 
with the development of the documents 
under consideration (including previous 
scientific peer review) before the 
candidate is considered further for 
service on the SACC. Selected 
candidates are required to complete an 
ethics training prior to conducting their 
reviews. 
3. Selection of Ad Hoc Reviewers 
The selection of scientists to serve as 
ad hoc reviewers for the SACC is based 
on the function of the Committee and 
the expertise needed to address the 
Agency’s charge to the Committee. No 
interested scientists shall be ineligible 
to serve by reason of their membership 
on any other advisory committee to a 
federal department or agency or their 
employment by a federal department or 
agency, except EPA. Other factors 
considered during the selection process 
include availability of the prospective 
candidate to fully participate in the 
Committee’s reviews, ability to be hired 
as an EPA Special Government 
Employee (SGE), absence of any 
conflicts of interest or appearance of 
loss of impartiality, independence with 
respect to the matters under review, and 
lack of bias. Although financial conflicts 
of interest, the appearance of loss of 
impartiality, lack of independence, and 
bias may result in non-selection, the 
absence of such concerns does not 
assure that a candidate will be selected 
to serve on the SACC. Numerous 
qualified candidates are often identified 
for SACC reviews. Therefore, selection 
decisions involve carefully weighing 
several factors including the candidates’ 
areas of expertise and professional 
qualifications and achieving an overall 
balance of different scientific 
perspectives across reviewers. 
At this time, EPA is seeking 
nominations to create a pool of ad hoc 
experts who can be available to the SACC to assist in reviews conducted by 
the Committee. EPA anticipates 
selecting experts from this pool, as 
needed, to assist the SACC in their 
review of the chemicals listed in Units 
II B1. and II.B2. The Agency will 
consider all nominations of prospective 
candidates for service as ad hoc 
reviewers for the SACC that are received 
on or before February 4, 2026. However, 
final selection of ad hoc reviewers is a 
discretionary function of the Agency. 
EPA plans to make a list of candidates 
under consideration as prospective ad 
hoc reviewers for these reviews available for public comment. The list 
will be available in the docket at https:// 
www.regulations.gov (docket identification number EPA–HQ–OPPT– 
2025–3358) and through the SACC 
website at https://www.epa.gov/tsca- 
peer-review. 
II. Background 
A. What is the purpose of the SACC? 
The SACC provides independent 
advice and recommendations to the EPA 
on the scientific and technical aspects of 
risk assessments, methodologies, and 
pollution prevention measures and 
approaches for chemicals regulated 
under TSCA. The SACC is comprised of 
experts in toxicology; environmental 
risk assessment; exposure assessment; 
and related sciences (e.g., synthetic biology, pharmacology, biotechnology, 
nanotechnology, biochemistry, 
biostatistics, physiologically based 
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, 
computational toxicology, 
epidemiology, environmental fate, 
environmental engineering and 
sustainability). The SACC currently 
consists of 19 members. When needed, 
the committee will be assisted by ad hoc 
reviewers with specific expertise in the 
topics under consideration. 
B. Background on Each Chemical 
1. Early 2026 Chemicals Under 
Consideration 
€1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8- hexamethylcyclopenta [g]-2-benzopyran 
(HHCB): HHCB is a synthetic polycyclic 
musk used in fragrances found in 
cleaners, detergents, and personal care 
products. EPA designated it as a High- 
Priority Substance for risk evaluation 
under TSCA in 2019. HHCB is released 
primarily via wastewater pathways and 
may persist in aquatic and sediment 
environments. EPA’s risk evaluation 
will address ecological toxicity, 
environmental fate, bioaccumulation, 
general population exposures, and 
human health impacts across conditions 
of use.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biological product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension an applicant may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human drug 
products, the testing phase begins when 
the exemption to permit the clinical 
investigations of the drug becomes 
effective and runs until the approval 
phase begins. The approval phase starts 
with the initial submission of an 
application to market the human drug 
product and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the drug product. 
Although only a portion of a regulatory 
review period may count toward the 
actual amount of extension that the 
Director of USPTO may award (for 
example, half the testing phase must be 
subtracted as well as any time that may 
have occurred before the patent was 
issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human drug product will include all 
of the testing phase and approval phase 
as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human drug product, AUGTYRO 
(repotrectinib), is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Subsequent to this approval, the USPTO 
received a patent term restoration 
application for AUGTYRO (U.S. Patent 
No. 9,714,258) from Turning Point 
Therapeutics, Inc. and the USPTO 
requested FDA’s assistance in 
determining the patent’s eligibility for 
patent term restoration. In a letter dated 
June 27, 2025, FDA advised the USPTO 
that this human drug product had 
undergone a regulatory review period 
and that the approval of AUGTYRO 
represented the first permitted 
commercial marketing or use of the 
product. Thereafter, the USPTO 
requested that FDA determine the 
product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
AUGTYRO is 2,574 days. Of this time, 
2,340 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 234 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
355(i)) became effective: October 30, 
2016. The applicant claims October 29, 
2016, as the date the investigational new 
drug application (IND) became effective. 
However, FDA records indicate that the 
IND effective date was, October 30, 
2016, which was 30 days after FDA 
receipt of the IND. 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human drug product under section 505 
of the FD&C Act: March 27, 2023. FDA 
has verified the applicant’s claim that 
the new drug application (NDA) for 
AUGTYRO (NDA 218213) was initially 
submitted on March 27, 2023. 
3. The date the application was approved: November 15, 2023. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that NDA 
218213 was approved on November 15, 
2023. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application(s) for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 1,027 days of patent 
term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written 
comments and, under 21 CFR 60.24, ask 
for a redetermination (see 
DATES). 
Furthermore, as specified in § 60.30 (21 
CFR 60.30), any interested person may 
petition FDA for a determination 
regarding whether the applicant for 
extension acted with due diligence 
during the regulatory review period. To 
meet its burden, the petition must 
comply with all the requirements of 
§ 60.30, including but not limited to: 
must be timely (see 
DATES), must be 
filed in accordance with § 10.20, must 
contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA 
investigation, and must certify that a 
true and complete copy of the petition 
has been served upon the patent 
applicant. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th 
Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41–42, 1984.) 
Petitions should be in the format 
specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

FDA has approved for marketing the 
human drug product, BRENZAVVY 
(bexagliflozin), indicated as an adjunct 
to diet and exercise to improve glycemic 
control in adults with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Subsequent to this approval, 
the USPTO received patent term 
restoration applications for 
BRENZAVVY (U.S. Patent Nos. 
7,838,499; 8,802,637; 10,533,032;

human drug product under section 505 
of the FD&C Act or section: October 22, 
2021. FDA has verified the applicant’s 
claim that the new drug application 
(NDA) for BRENZAVVY (NDA 214373) 
was initially submitted on October 22, 
2021. 
3. The date the application was approved: January 20, 2023. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that NDA 
214373 was approved on January 20, 
2023.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug or biological product, animal drug 
product, medical device, food additive, 
or color additive) was subject to 
regulatory review by FDA before the 
item was marketed. Under these acts, a 
product’s regulatory review period 
forms the basis for determining the 
amount of extension an applicant may 
receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: a testing phase and 
an approval phase. For human drug 
products, the testing phase begins when 
the exemption to permit the clinical 
investigations of the drug becomes 
effective and runs until the approval 
phase begins. The approval phase starts 
with the initial submission of an 
application to market the human drug 
product and continues until FDA grants 
permission to market the drug product. 
Although only a portion of a 
regulatory review period may count 
toward the actual amount of extension 
that the Director of USPTO may award 
(for example, half the testing phase must 
be subtracted as well as any time that 
may have occurred before the patent 
was issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a human drug product will include all 
of the testing phase and approval phase 
as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
human drug product, IZERVAY 
(avacincaptad pegol sodium), indicated 
for the treatment of geographic atrophy 
(GA) secondary to age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD). Subsequent to this 
approval, the USPTO received patent 
term restoration applications for 
IZERVAY (U.S. Patent Nos. 7,579,456; 
8,236,773; 9,617,546; 11,273,171) from 
IVERIC bio, Inc. and the USPTO 
requested FDA’s assistance in 
determining the patents’ eligibility for 
patent term restoration. In a letter dated 
June 27, 2025, FDA advised the USPTO 
that this human drug product had 
undergone a regulatory review period 
and that the approval of IZERVAY 
represented the first permitted 
commercial marketing or use of the 
product. Thereafter, the USPTO 
requested that FDA determine the 
product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
IZERVAY is 6,383 days. Of this time, 
6,154 days occurred during the testing 
phase of the regulatory review period, 
while 229 days occurred during the 
approval phase. These periods of time 
were derived from the following dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 
355(i)) became effective: February 13, 
2006. The applicant claims June 29, 
2008, as the date the investigational new 
drug application (IND) became effective. 
However, FDA records indicate that the 
IND effective date was February 13, 
2006, which was 30 days after FDA 
receipt of an earlier IND 
2. The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the 
human drug product under section 505 
of the FD&C Act: December 19, 2022. 
FDA has verified the applicant’s claim 
that the new drug application (NDA) for 
IZERVAY (NDA 217225) was initially 
submitted on December 19, 2022. 
3. The date the application was approved: August 4, 2023. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that NDA

2023. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application(s) for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 369, 1,268, or 5 
years of patent term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written 
comments and, under 21 CFR 60.24, ask 
for a redetermination (see 
DATES). 
Furthermore, as specified in § 60.30 (21

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
The Drug Price Competition and 
Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 
(Pub. L. 98–417) and the Generic 
Animal Drug and Patent Term 
Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100–670) 
generally provide that a patent may be 
extended for a period of up to 5 years 
so long as the patented item (human 
drug product, animal drug product, 
medical device, food additive, or color 
additive) was subject to regulatory 
review by FDA before the item was 
marketed. Under these acts, a product’s 
regulatory review period forms the basis 
for determining the amount of extension 
an applicant may receive. 
A regulatory review period consists of 
two periods of time: A testing phase and 
an approval phase. For medical devices, 
the testing phase begins with a clinical 
investigation of the device and runs 
until the approval phase begins. The 
approval phase starts with the initial 
submission of an application to market 
the device and continues until 
permission to market the device is 
granted. Although only a portion of a 
regulatory review period may count 
toward the actual amount of extension 
that the Director of USPTO may award 
(for example, half the testing phase must 
be subtracted as well as any time that 
may have occurred before the patent 
was issued), FDA’s determination of the 
length of a regulatory review period for 
a medical device will include all of the 
testing phase and approval phase as 
specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(3)(B). 
FDA has approved for marketing the 
medical device, MEDIBEACON. 
MEDIBEACON is intended to assess the 
Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in 
adult patients with impaired or normal 
renal function by noninvasively 
monitoring fluorescent light emission 
from an exogenous tracer agent over 
time. This device has been validated in 
patients with stable renal function. The 
MediBeacon

TGFR is not approved for 
use in patients with GFR <15 ml/min/ 
1.73 m2, GFR >120 ml/min/1.73m2, 
patients on dialysis, or anuric patients. 
The use of this device in patients with 
dynamic and rapidly changing renal 
function has not been validated. This 
device is not intended to diagnose acute 
kidney injury (AKI). The MediBeacon

 
TGFR Sensor and exogenous tracer 
agent, Lumitrace

injection, are single 
use and are only used with the 
MediBeacon

TGFR. The MediBeacon

 
TGFR Sensor is a single use device 
intended to attach to the patient’s skin 
and excite fluorescence in Lumitrace

 
injection, the tracer agent, and measure 
the returning light intensity. The data is 
sent to the MediBeacon

TGFR Monitor. 
Lumitrace

is an injectable exogenous 
fluorescent tracer indicated for use with 
the MediBeacon

Transdermal GFR 
System (TGFR) for Glomerular Filtration 
Rate assessment. Subsequent to this 
approval, the USPTO received patent 
term restoration applications for 
MEDIBEACON (U.S. Patent Nos. 
8,115,000; RE47,413) from Medibeacon 
Inc., and the USPTO requested FDA’s 
assistance in determining this patents’ 
eligibility for patent term restoration. In 
a letter dated June 27, 2025, FDA 
advised the Patent and Trademark 
Office that this medical device had 
undergone a regulatory review period 
and that the approval of MEDIBEACON 
represented the first permitted 
commercial marketing or use of the 
product. Thereafter, the USPTO 
requested that the FDA determine the 
product’s regulatory review period. 
II. Determination of Regulatory Review 
Period 
FDA has determined that the 
applicable regulatory review period for 
MEDIBEACON is 4,175 days. Of this 
time, 3,598 days occurred during the 
testing phase of the regulatory review 
period, while 577 days occurred during 
the approval phase. These periods of 
time were derived from the following 
dates: 
1. The date an exemption under section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 
360j(g)) involving this device became 
effective: August 15, 2013. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that the 
date the investigational device 
exemption (IDE) required under section 
520(g) of the act for human tests to begin 
became effective August 15, 2013. 
2. The date an application was initially submitted with respect to the 
device under section 515 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
360e): June 21, 2023. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that the premarket 
approval application (PMA) for 
MEDIBEACON (PMA P230019) was 
initially submitted June 21, 2023. 
3. The date the application was approved: January 17, 2025. FDA has verified the applicant’s claim that PMA 
P230019 was approved on January 17, 
2025. 
This determination of the regulatory 
review period establishes the maximum 
potential length of a patent extension. 
However, the USPTO applies several 
statutory limitations in its calculations 
of the actual period for patent extension. 
In its application(s) for patent extension, 
this applicant seeks 5 years of patent 
term extension. 
III. Petitions 
Anyone with knowledge that any of 
the dates as published are incorrect may 
submit either electronic or written

October 1, 2025, with proposed updates 
to the HRSA-supported Women’s 
Preventive Services Guidelines 
(Guidelines). The proposed updates 
specifically relate to recommendations 
for Screening for Cervical Cancer. 
Recommendations to update the 
Guidelines are developed under a

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES284 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices HRSA-funded cooperative agreement, 
the Women’s Preventive Services 
Initiative (WPSI), for consideration by 
HRSA. Under this agreement, WPSI 
convenes expert health professionals to 
conduct rigorous reviews of the 
evidence following the National 
Academy of Medicine standards for 
establishing foundations for and rating 
strengths of recommendations, 
articulation of recommendations, and 
external reviews, and it developed draft 
recommendations for HRSA’s 
consideration. After consideration of 
public comment, HRSA has accepted 
the recommendations as revised and 
detailed in this notice. Under applicable 
law, non-grandfathered group health 
plans and health insurance issuers 
offering non-grandfathered group and 
individual health insurance coverage 
must include coverage, without cost 
sharing, for certain preventive services, 
including those provided for in the 
HRSA-supported Guidelines. The 
Departments of Labor, HHS, and the 
Treasury have previously issued 
regulations describing how group health 
plans and health insurance issuers 
apply the coverage requirements. Please 
see https://www.hrsa.gov/womens- guidelines for additional information. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: 
Kimberly Sherman, HRSA, Maternal 
and Child Health Bureau, telephone:

hrsa.gov. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act, Public Law 111–148, the preventive 
care and screenings set forth in the 
Guidelines are required to be covered 
without cost-sharing by certain group 
health plans and health insurance 
issuers. HRSA established the 
Guidelines in 2011 based on expert 
recommendations by the Institute of 
Medicine, now known as the National 
Academy of Medicine, developed under 
a contract with HHS. Since 2016, HRSA 
has funded cooperative agreements for 
WPSI to convene a coalition 
representing clinicians, academics, and 
consumer-focused health professional 
organizations to conduct a rigorous 
review of current scientific evidence, 
solicit and consider public input, and 
make recommendations to HRSA 
regarding updates to the Guidelines to 
improve adult women’s health across 
the lifespan. HRSA then determines 
whether to support, in whole or in part, 
the recommended updates to the 
Guidelines. 
For clarity, note that the 
Implementation Considerations address 
aspects of clinical and practical 
application of the Clinical 
Recommendations. Research 
Recommendations are provided to 
highlight areas where further research 
and clinical trials are needed to inform 
the development of Clinical 
Recommendations. The Implementation 
Considerations and Research 
Recommendations sections are not a 
part of the Clinical Recommendations 
accepted by the HRSA Administrator 
and therefore have no impact on health 
insurance coverage without cost- 
sharing. In the description of responses 
to the public comments below, the term 
‘‘recommendation’’ is sometimes used 
in place of ‘‘Clinical Recommendation.’’ 
Recommended updates to the 
Guidelines are based on review and 
synthesis of existing clinical guidelines 
and new scientific evidence, following 
robust standards for establishing 
foundations for and rating strengths of 
recommendations, articulation of 
recommendations, and external reviews. 
Additionally, HRSA provides 
opportunity for public comment, 
including participation by patients and 
consumers, in the development of the 
Guidelines. 
Discussion of Recommended Updated 
Guideline 
As is standard practice, HRSA 
published a Federal Register Notice 
seeking public comment regarding the 
proposed updates to the Guidelines for 
Screening for Cervical Cancer (90 FR 
47313 (Oct. 1, 2025)). All public 
comments were reviewed and 
considered as part of the deliberative 
process. A total of 42 responses were 
received, with each response containing 
one or more distinct comments. 
Screening for Cervical Cancer 
WPSI recommended retaining the 
existing Guideline on Screening for 
Cervical Cancer, with several updates to 
the language. Language of the final 
Clinical Recommendation is set out at 
the end of this Notice. 
€The first change is the use of the full form of Women’s Preventive 
Services Initiative, instead of the 
acronym WPSI, in the first sentence of 
the Guideline. 
€The second change occurs in the second sentence of the Guideline and 
only restructures the sentence for clarity 
and does not provide any changes to the 
recommendation. 
€Next, the abbreviation ‘‘hrHPV’’ was added after the term ‘‘human 
papillomavirus’’ for consistency and 
increased clarity that the 
recommendation is specific to high-risk 
HPV types. Corresponding revisions 
using the abbreviation are provided 
throughout the remaining text of the 
updated recommendation. 
€The word ‘‘co-testing’’ was previously unhyphenated in the 
recommendation; a hyphen was added 
in the latest version of the 
recommendation. 
€WPSI updated the Guideline regarding cervical cancer testing for 
women aged 30–65 and added ‘‘primary 
hrHPV testing every 5 years (preferred) 
or cytology and hrHPV testing (co- 
testing) every 5 years. If hrHPV testing 
is not available, continue screening with 
cytology alone every 3 years.’’ This 
update reflects current evidence-based 
practice on testing and interval 
screening. 
€Next, a new sentence was added (‘‘Patient-collected hrHPV testing is an 
appropriate method and should be 
offered as an option for cervical cancer 
screening in women aged 30 to 65 years 
at average risk.’’) to reflect the new 
evidence and developments supporting 
the expansion of options for cervical 
cancer screening through patient- 
collected hrHPV testing. 
€The last update to the Guideline adds language on additional testing to 
complete the cervical cancer screening 
process (‘‘Additional testing may be 
required to complete the screening 
process and follow-up findings on the 
initial screening. If additional testing 
(e.g., cytology, biopsy colposcopy, extended genotyping, dual stain) and 
pathologic evaluation are indicated, 
these services also are recommended to 
complete the screening process for 
malignancies.’’). This update ensures 
the screening process for malignancies 
is complete should additional testing 
services (e.g., cytology, biopsy colposcopy, extended genotyping, dual 
stain) and pathologic evaluation be 
clinically indicated. Additional testing 
to complete the screening process 
covers all cases of cervical cancer 
screening, regardless of whether the test 
was collected by the patient or clinician. 
HRSA received 42 responses on these 
proposed updates, with each response 
containing one or more distinct 
comments. Public comments were 
largely positive about the updated 
Guideline, with an overwhelming 
majority of respondents expressing 
support for at least one component of 
the recommendation. The comments 
have been reviewed and organized into 
categories, with overview summaries of 
comments and responses provided 
below: 
€Adjusting Screening by Risk-Level/ Defining Average Risk: 
ÆComments: Thirteen comments suggested adjustments to screening by 
risk, socioeconomic group, or age with 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00057 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES285 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices some requesting screening past 65, 
before age 20, and others requesting 
screening begin at age 25 in alignment 
with other guidelines. Four of these 
comments requested a definition for 
average risk. 
ÆResponse: The evidence review did not determine a need to change the age 
for the start or stop of screening. Among 
the five major guidelines for average- 
risk women examined in the evidence 
review, four aligned on the same 
starting age, and all five recommended 
concluding screening at age 65. These 
guidelines are meant for average-risk 
women, a definition of which is 
available in the full evidence review 
(https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/ 
files/hrsa/about/cervical-cancer- 
screening-update.pdf); the 
Implementation Considerations also 
provides notes around how WPSI 
defines average-risk. Screening 
approaches for those at high-risk are 
outside the scope of these 
recommendations. At present, the 
evidence does not support tailoring 
screening approaches based on 
socioeconomics. Accordingly, these 
comments were not accepted and no 
change was made in response to these 
comments. 
€Uniform Data System/Healthcare Effectiveness and Data Information Set 
Alignment: 
ÆComments: Ten comments noted that the addition of self-collection for 
cervical cancer screening provides the 
opportunity for HRSA to collect 
information through its Uniform Data 
System (UDS) for health centers for 
‘‘member-collected samples’’ for 
cervical cancer screening that would 
align with an existing measure noted in 
the 2024 Healthcare Effectiveness and 
Data Information Set (HEDIS) General 
Guidelines used by health plans; one of 
these commentors requested UDS be 
revised to adopt the HEDIS measure 
language. 
Another comment recommended that 
specific language be added to the 
recommendation to improve data 
collection in the UDS by socioeconomic 
subgroups as well as metrics regarding 
issues with screening (such as ‘‘never- 
screened,’’ ‘‘delayed-initiation,’’ etc.). 
ÆResponse: While these comments go beyond the scope of this evidence 
review and recommendation, and thus 
no changes were made to the 
recommendation, HRSA has shared 
these observations and suggestions with 
HRSA staff that administer the Health 
Center Program, including UDS. 
€Supporting Implementation, Follow-up Care, and Public Education: 
ÆComments: Seven comments were provided that focused on supporting 
implementation, follow-up, and public 
education on the updated 
recommendation. Six of these comments 
requested more support/systems to 
address follow-up of positive results for 
home-based self-collection, particularly 
given concerns around loss to follow-up 
and access for underserved populations. 
One of these comments specifically 
requested expansion of community- 
based services and language on patient 
navigation for follow-up. 
ÆResponse: While these comments go beyond the scope of this evidence 
review and recommendation, it should 
be noted that starting January 1, 2026, 
the evidence-based WPSI Patient 
Navigation Services for Breast and 
Cervical Cancer Screening Guideline, 89 
FR 106522 (Dec. 30, 2024), takes effect, 
providing person-to-person navigation 
services without patient copay. A 
reminder of this recommendation has 
been added to the Implementation 
Considerations and additional research 
on the impact of patient navigation on 
follow-up care is already noted in the 
Research Recommendations. 
ÆComments: Two comments requested more language delineating all 
necessary follow-up procedures/care or 
circumstances for additional testing; one 
of these requested specific language on 
an in-person follow-up visit for positive 
self-collected test results. 
ÆResponse: While specific follow-up procedures and management of 
abnormal results are beyond the scope 
of the evidence review and 
recommendation, a note has been added 
to the Implementation Considerations 
stating follow-up for abnormal test 
results should follow established 
clinical guidelines. 
ÆComments: Three of the seven comments suggested more robust 
outreach and education efforts, with one 
of the three asking for education to be 
tailored to highest need. 
ÆResponse: While these comments go beyond the scope of this evidence 
review and recommendation, additional 
language has been added to the 
Implementation Considerations on the 
importance of patient-centered 
discussion and education, as well as the 
WPSI Patient Navigation Services for 
Breast and Cervical Cancer Screening 
Guideline, as noted above. 
€Equal Preference for hrHPV, Cytology, and Co-Testing/Adjusting 
Preferences: 
ÆComments: Seven comments requested equal weight be given to 
cytology, hrHPV, and co-testing, 
removing the preference for primary 
hrHPV testing; a number of these 
comments mentioned a desire to align 
with the draft 2024 U.S. Preventive 
Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
guideline. One comment requested 
cytology be used in conjunction with 
hrHPV testing. 
ÆResponse: As per the 2025 WPSI evidence review, newer evidence 
released since the 2024 USPSTF 
evidence review informs primary hrHPV 
based screening for the 30 to 65 year age 
group as the preferred method, with 
increased detection of precancer 
compared with cytology-based 
screening and lower rates of precancer 
with subsequent screening seen with 
this modality. As such, these comments 
were not accepted and no change was 
made in response to these comments. 
€FDA Intended Use for Self- Collection and Other: 
ÆComments: Six comments mentioned concerns related to FDA 
approvals, and included concern that 
the FDA intended use for self-collected 
samples is only for situations when a 
clinician-collected sample cannot be 
obtained, a desire to note in the 
recommendation that FDA approvals are 
required for use, or other perceived 
FDA-related/regulatory limitations. 
ÆResponse: In May 2025, the FDA approved the first at-home cervical 
cancer screening self-collection kit; this 
follows their earlier May 2024 approval 
of in-clinic self-collection kits for the 
same purpose. To provide additional 
clarity, a note was added to the 
Implementation Considerations on FDA 
approved methods. 
€Self-Collection Screening Frequency Changed to Shorter Interval: 
ÆComments: Five comments requested a shorter screening frequency 
for self-collected samples. 
ÆResponse: No changes were made to the recommendation as self-collected 
samples had a similar test accuracy as 
clinician-collected samples and WPSI’s 
evidence review did not support 
changing to an increased frequency of 
screening. A Research Recommendation 
has been added to address this. 
€Self-Collections as a Secondary Option: 
ÆComments: Five comments recommended self-collection as a 
secondary option or that it be 
considered only for select populations. 
ÆResponse: The WPSI evidence review concluded that self-collected 
vaginal hrHPV has similar test accuracy 
for precancer when compared to 
clinician-collected samples, yielding 
similar proportions of positive screening 
results. Self-collection can also increase 
screening uptake, which facilitates 
earlier detection of cervical disease. 
Earlier detection is associated with 
improved treatment outcomes and, 
ultimately, the potential to prevent more

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES286 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices cervical cancer–related deaths. 
Accordingly, these comments were not 
accepted and no change was made in 
response to these comments. 
€Lack of U.S. Data: ÆComments: Three commentors mentioned a concern over the use of 
European studies or the lack of U.S. data 
around self-collection or preference for 
primary hrHPV testing. 
ÆResponse: The studies used in the WPSI evidence review were comparable 
to the broader U.S. population for the 
research questions examined. Most 
comparative screening studies used in 
the WPSI Evidence Review’s analysis 
were conducted in countries with 
organized screening programs similar to 
the U.S., along with one large 
population cohort study conducted in a 
U.S. health setting with an organized 
screening program representing a 
diverse group of patients. Accordingly, 
these comments were not accepted and 
no change was made to the 
recommendation in response to these 
comments. 
€Clarifications on Additional Screening to Complete the Screening 
Process: 
ÆComments: Two comments requested defining ‘‘additional 
screening’’ and what constitutes the end 
of screening, particularly for the 
purposes of billing and coding, with one 
of these comments requesting 
information on what to do about 
inconclusive results and two comments 
requesting guidance on coding and 
billing for the additional tests. 
ÆResponse: This change to the recommendation was made in 
alignment with similar language in the 
breast cancer screening guideline, added 
in 2024, which also recommended 
additional testing to complete the 
screening process for malignancies. 
While billing and coding are not 
specifically addressed by the Clinical 
Recommendation, the Center for 
Consumer Information and Insurance 
Oversight and the tri-department 
committee, made up of the Department 
of Labor, the Department of the 
Treasury, and HHS, makes 
determinations regarding coverage and 
can be approached for assistance with 
billing and coding. As reflected in the 
recommendation, an inconclusive result 
would require additional testing to 
complete the screening process. As 
such, no change to the recommendation 
was made in response to these 
comments. 
€For and Against Extended Genotyping During Primary Screening: 
ÆComments: One commenter noted that they do not recommend routine 
extended genotyping with primary 
screening and appreciated the addition 
of ‘‘hr’’ in front of HPV to help indicate 
this, while another two comments 
requested including extended 
genotyping as part of primary screening. 
ÆResponse: No changes were made to the recommendation as there was no 
evidence to support extended 
genotyping during primary screen for 
average risk populations. 
€Additional Technical Details Requested Comments and Responses: 
ÆThree comments requested additional technical details. 
One of these comments requested 
additional technical details including a 
need to test patients/partners for anal 
and oropharyngeal HPV, which was 
outside the scope of this 
recommendation and thus no change 
was made. 
One comment requested exit 
screening protocols, which is already 
mentioned in the Implementation 
Considerations. 
An additional comment supported 
hrHPV as the preferred method of 
testing but suggested including language 
indicating that other forms of screening, 
such as co-testing, are also effective. 
This language is reflected in the existing 
recommendation, thus no additional 
changes were made. 
€Single Comments and Responses: ÆSingle comments were received on the following topics: 
One commenter requested the 
evidence review, which can be accessed 
by visiting HRSA’s Women’s Preventive 
Services Guidelines pages https://
www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines). No 
change was made to the 
recommendation in response to this 
comment. 
One comment was concerned the 
recommendation may lead to women 
having fewer gynecologic exams and 
potential increases in associated 
cancers. No changes were made as this 
recommendation does not change 
existing WPSI recommendations around 
the annual well-woman visit or any 
existing preventive cancer screenings 
connected to ongoing well-woman care. 
One comment shared a concern that 
the recommendation will weaken 
reimbursement and institutional 
support. This comment was beyond the 
scope of the evidence review and 
recommendation, and no change was 
made. 
One comment stressed the need to 
ensure scientific integrity for the 
development of the recommendation, 
which is a shared priority for HHS and 
HRSA. The evidence-based guideline 
development process is described 
elsewhere in this notice. No change was 
made to the recommendation in 
response to this comment. 
One comment requested more 
inclusive language. No change was 
made based on this comment, as the 
guideline relates to all women at 
average risk of cervical cancer. 
One comment requested a Research 
Recommendation to better assess age for 
first screening, which was added to the 
Research Recommendations. 
Another comment requested more 
research on the best ways for providers 
to communicate to underserved groups. 
No change was made in response to this 
comment, as this goes beyond the scope 
of this evidence review and 
recommendation. 
One commenter suggested adding a 
comma between ‘‘biopsy’’ and 
‘‘colposcopy’’ in the final 
recommendation. The guideline was 
updated to include this grammatical 
edit, which does not change the 
substance or intent of the 
recommendation. 
Acceptance of Recommendation 
On December 29, 2025, the HRSA 
Administrator accepted WPSI’s 
recommendation, which is revised as 
described above, and, as such, updated 
the HRSA-supported Women’s 
Preventive Services Guidelines. The 
final Guideline for this topic reads as 
follows: 
Screening for Cervical Cancer 
‘‘The Women’s Preventive Services 
Initiative recommends cervical cancer 
screening for average-risk women aged 
21 to 65 years. For women aged 21 to 
29 years, cervical cancer screening using 
cervical cytology (Pap test) every 3 years 
is recommended. Co-testing with 
cytology and human papillomavirus 
(hrHPV) testing is not recommended for 
women younger than 30 years. Women 
aged 30 to 65 years should be screened 
with primary hrHPV testing every 5 
years (preferred) or cytology and hrHPV 
testing (co-testing) every 5 years. If 
hrHPV testing is not available, continue 
screening with cytology alone every 3 
years. Women who are at average risk 
should not be screened more than once 
every 3 years. Patient-collected hrHPV 
testing is an appropriate method and 
should be offered as an option for 
cervical cancer screening in women 
aged 30 to 65 years at average risk. 
Additional testing may be required to 
complete the screening process and 
follow-up findings on the initial 
screening. If additional testing (e.g., 
cytology, biopsy, colposcopy, extended 
genotyping, dual stain) and pathologic 
evaluation are indicated, these services

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Legal Authority 
Section 306 of the Controlled 
Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. 826) 
requires the Attorney General to 
establish production quotas for each 
basic class of controlled substance listed 
in schedule I and II and ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine, and 
phenylpropanolamine. The Attorney 
General has delegated this function to 
the Administrator of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
pursuant to 28 CFR 0.100. 
II. Background 
The 2026 aggregate production quotas 
(APQ) and assessment of annual needs 
(AAN) represent those quantities of 
schedule I and II controlled substances 
and the list I chemicals ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine, and 
phenylpropanolamine that may be 
manufactured in the United States in 
2026 in order to provide for the 
estimated medical, scientific, research, 
and industrial needs of the U.S., lawful 
export requirements, and the 
establishment and maintenance of 
reserve stocks. These quotas include 
imports of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, 
and phenylpropanolamine, but do not 
include imports of controlled 
substances for use in industrial 
processes. 
On November 28, 2025, a notice titled 
‘‘Proposed Aggregate Production Quotas 
for Schedule I and II Controlled 
Substances and Assessment of Annual 
Needs for the List I Chemicals 
Ephedrine, Pseudoephedrine, and 
Phenylpropanolamine for 2026’’ was 
published in the Federal Register.
1
This 
notice proposed the 2026 APQs for each 
basic class of controlled substance listed 
in schedules I and II and the 2026 AANs 
for the list I chemicals ephedrine, 
pseudoephedrine, and 
phenylpropanolamine. All interested 
persons were invited to comment on or 
object to the proposed APQs and the 
proposed AANs on or before December 
15, 2025. 
III. Comments Received 
Within the public comment period, 
DEA received 5,044 comments from 
DEA registrants, chronic pain patients, 
patients with attention deficit/ 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pain 
advocacy associations, U.S. professional 
associations, U.S. doctors and nurses, 
and others. The comments included 
concerns about perceived domestic 
opioid drug shortages due to further 
quota reductions; patient difficulty 
filling authorized opioid and stimulant 
prescriptions; increases in drug 
overdose deaths despite a continued 
decrease in production quotas; concerns 
that medical professionals might be 
impeded from exercising their medical 
expertise regarding opioid prescriptions; 
concerns of ADHD medication efficacy 
and shortages based on quotas 
associated with isomer ratios; ordering 
thresholds for pharmacies, data 
collection and methodology; tools used 
to determine diversion estimates; 
adequate quotas for research purposes, 
stake holder collaboration; requests for 
a public hearing; requests for an 
extension to the comment period; and 
comments not pertaining to DEA- 
regulated activities. While all comments 
were posted to regulations.gov, DEA 
restricted the attachments to 22 
comments from public view due to 
confidential business information and/ 
or confidential personal identifying 
information. 
Pain Medication (Schedule II Opioids) 
Issue (Medication Out of Stock at 
Pharmacy Level): Many commenters 
expressed that due to the decreases in 
the aggregate production quotas for 
oxycodone and hydrocodone, they have 
had difficulty filling legitimate 
prescriptions. They stated they often 
experienced delays or have to visit 
multiple pharmacies to get their 
prescriptions filled. These issues have 
negatively impacted their quality of life 
and caused mental health-related issues, 
possibly leading to suicide. 
Additionally, commenters expressed 
concerns over the cardiovascular effects 
they experienced when pain is left 
untreated for an extended period of time 
due to the delay in getting medications. 
DEA Response: DEA is committed to 
ensuring an adequate and uninterrupted 
supply of controlled substances in order 
to meet legitimate medical, scientific, 
and export needs of the United States. 
DEA utilizes the available, reliable data 
and information received by the agency 
at the time APQs are proposed and 
proactively monitors drug production, 
distribution and supply during the year. 
However, drug shortages may occur due 
to factors outside of DEA’s control such 
as manufacturing and quality problems, 
processing delays, supply chain 
disruptions, or discontinuations. In 
such circumstances, if the drug 
manufacturer notifies the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) Drug 
Shortage Staff, FDA will coordinate 
with DEA to address and minimize the 
impact of drug shortages if both 
agencies believe action is warranted. 
Currently, FDA has not listed on its 
Drug Shortage website any nationwide 
shortages of oxycodone and

receiving their medications, the patient 
may request a one-time transfer of initial 
dispensing of an electronic prescription 
for Schedules II–V controlled 
substances from one retail pharmacy to 
another retail pharmacy if authorized 
under state law. If the medication is a 
controlled substance in Schedules III–V 
and includes authorized refills, the 
refills can also be transferred with the 
initial prescription to the receiving 
pharmacy. 
Issue: (Shortage of injectable opioid 
products): DEA received comments from palliative care associations, healthcare 
companies, and manufacturers 
regarding the listing of injectable opioid 
medications including fentanyl, 
hydromorphone, and morphine on the 
FDA’s Drug Shortage website and the 
proposed reduction of the APQs for 
fentanyl, hydromorphone, and 
morphine. 
DEA Response: DEA is committed to 
ensuring an adequate and uninterrupted 
supply of controlled substances in order 
to meet the estimated legitimate 
medical, scientific, research, and 
industrial needs of the United States, for 
lawful export requirements, and for the 
establishment and maintenance of 
reserve stocks. Opioid injectable 
products utilize less than 5% of the 
relevant APQ. The remainder of the 
APQ is used to manufacture other 
opioid dosage forms. Therefore, 
injectable shortages do not usually 
require changes to the relevant APQ. 
Based on the data that DEA is required 
to consider for setting the APQs, DEA 
has determined that the established 
APQs for opioids are sufficient to meet 
all legitimate needs for 2026. As 
mentioned above, DEA proactively 
monitors drug production, distribution 
and supply during the year. 
Additionally, DEA and FDA are 
required to, and routinely do, 
coordinate efforts to prevent or alleviate 
drug shortages pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 
826(h). Such efforts may include 
adjusting the APQ, adjusting individual 
domestic manufacturers’ quotas, FDA 
approval of additional market 
competitors, and coordination between 
the agencies to allow importation of 
foreign-manufactured drug products 
that meet FDA approval. 
Issue (Opioid Prescribing Hesitancy): 
Many self-identified chronic pain 
patients expressed that they are 
obtaining opioid pain medications 
legally and taking them as prescribed. 
Commenters stated that many chronic 
pain patients experience a decreased 
quality of life, and some have died by 
suicide, due to the inability to get 
prescriptions from their providers, 
which they allege is directly related to 
the APQ reductions made by DEA. 
Many commenters also stated that 
restrictions imposed by DEA have 
caused opioid medications to be under- 
prescribed due to fear of prosecution. 
Commenters said doctors should have 
latitude in making treatment decisions 
to prescribe opioid pain medications 
based on individual patient needs. 
DEA Response: DEA’s regulations do 
not impose restrictions on the amount 
and the type of medication that licensed 
practitioners can prescribe. DEA has 
consistently emphasized and supported 
the authority of individual practitioners 
under the CSA to administer, dispense, 
and prescribe controlled substances for 
the legitimate treatment of pain within 
acceptable medical standards, as 
outlined in DEA’s policy statement 
‘‘Dispensing Controlled Substances for 
the Treatment of Pain’’ published in the 
Federal Register on September 6, 2006.

Issue (Patients Switching to Illicit 
Fentanyl or Medications Obtained from 
Illegal Sources): Several commenters 
expressed concerns that chronic pain 
sufferers will turn to illegal fentanyl or 
medications obtained from illegitimate 
sources for relief if they are unable to 
fill their legitimate prescriptions due to 
the reduction of quotas for opioids. 
They stated that overdose deaths in the 
United States continue to rise as a result 
of illegal fentanyl or illegitimate 
medications, rather than from legally 
prescribed medications for the treatment 
of chronic pain. 
DEA Response: DEA considered 
various factors such as the estimation of 
legitimate medical need provided by the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS), as well as the extent of 
any diversion, when proposing and 
establishing the APQs for opioids to 
ensure there is an adequate supply to 
meet legitimate medical demand while 
preventing diversion (21 CFR 
1303.11(b)). Pursuant to the Substance 
Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes 
Opioid Recovery and Treatment for 
Patients and Communities (SUPPORT) 
Act (Pub. L. 115–271), DEA is mandated 
to estimate diversion for fentanyl, 
hydrocodone, hydromorphone, 
oxycodone and oxymorphone, and this 
estimation includes the consideration of 
rates of overdose deaths. While 
overdose deaths may still occur from the 
use of illicit substances, DEA 
implemented quota regulations such 
that the occurrences of overdose and 
death caused by the misuse and 
diversion of pharmaceutical controlled 
substances are reduced. Patients are 
encouraged to work closely with their 
licensed healthcare practitioners to 
utilize FDA-approved medications for 
their conditions and to fill their 
prescriptions only from DEA-registered 
pharmacies. Medications received from 
unregistered internet sources may, in 
fact, be manufactured or laced with 
illicit substances including illicit 
fentanyl, which contribute to rates of 
overdose deaths. 
Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) Medication 
Issue (isomer ratio): Several self- 
identified ADHD patients claimed that 
they have been negatively impacted by 
the poor quality and ineffectiveness of 
their prescribed Adderall or 
amphetamine mixed salt products. They 
claimed that the manufacturing of 
Adderall dosages requires a 3:1 isomeric 
ratio of d-amphetamine to l- 
amphetamine, and that dosage form 
manufacturers are unable to procure the 
proper ratio of isomers because DEA is 
allocating d-amphetamine and l- 
amphetamine to dosage manufacturers 
in a fixed one-to-one ratio, thus affecting 
the effectiveness and quality of the 
medication and a shortage of the 
medication. 
Response: The FDA is a regulatory agency under HHS that has the 
authority to oversee and regulate the 
safety, efficacy and manufacturing 
quality of drugs sold in the United 
States. The FDA monitors and ensures 
manufacturers’ compliance with all 
applicable requirements, including 
Current Good Manufacturing Practices 
(cGMP) regulations. Patients should 
raise concerns with their licensed 
healthcare provider or pharmacist if 
they find that their prescribed 
medications are ineffective in treating 
their conditions. 
DEA does not allocate d-amphetamine 
and l-amphetamine quotas in a fixed 
one-to-one ratio because the 
manufacturers do not request d- 
amphetamine and l-amphetamine 
quotas in a 1:1 ratio. When DEA 
upgraded the quota application process 
from paper to electronic, DEA noticed 
that manufacturers did not request 
quota for l-amphetamine but, preferred 
to request quota for d,l-amphetamine. 
The d,l-amphetamine APQ represents 
the racemic mixture of d- and l- 
amphetamine expressed as base. A 
racemic mixture is considered a 50:50 
ratio of left and right-handed mirror 
images, in this instance, the 50:50 ratio 
is of d-amphetamine and l- 
amphetamine. Therefore, the currently 
established and proposed aggregate 
production quotas of d,l-amphetamine 
and d-amphetamine are allocated to

that amphetamine mixed salt products 
can be manufactured in accordance with 
the drug’s approval, following cGMP 
standards and quality control practices 
as required by FDA. 
Ordering Thresholds for Pharmacies 
Issue: Commenters mentioned that as a result of the national opioid 
settlements, wholesale drug distributors 
have increasingly imposed ordering 
thresholds or limits on pharmacies, 
thereby impacting patient access to 
opioids. According to the commenters, 
distributors often flag an increase in 
controlled substance orders by 
pharmacies as suspicious, which can 
lead to denials or contract termination. 
Pharmacies with a record of distributor- 
initiated contract terminations may then 
face difficulties in securing new 
contracts with other distributors, as 
prior terminations are viewed as red 
flags. Therefore, pharmacies may be 
unwilling to increase their purchasing 
orders to meet legitimate medical need 
for fear that doing so could trigger 
distributors to cancel their contract. A 
commenter also expressed concerns that 
valid prescriptions to patients in 
hospice may not be fulfilled because 
pharmacies are unwilling to increase 
their controlled substances orders in 
fear of contract cancellations. The 
commenters encourage DEA to ensure 
that distributors are properly identifying 
and evaluating suspicious orders, and to 
allow pharmacies that were 
unintentionally suspended or 
terminated by their distributors to 
undergo a voluntary DEA inspection to 
verify that the prescriptions they filled 
were legitimate. 
DEA Response: The APQs established 
by DEA set a limit to the total quantity 
of a controlled substance that may be 
produced by all manufacturers in a 
calendar year, and do not impose any 
ordering thresholds or limits to 
pharmacies purchasing controlled 
substance medications from 
distributors. 
Establishing APQs in Terms of Dosage 
Forms 
Issue: DEA received a comment from a healthcare company suggesting DEA 
establish the annual APQs in terms of 
pharmaceutical dosage forms. 
DEA Response: Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 
826(a)(1), ‘‘production quotas shall be 
established in terms of quantities of 
each basic class of controlled substance 
and not in terms of individual 
pharmaceutical dosage forms prepared 
from or containing such a controlled 
substance.’’ DEA sets APQ in a manner 
to support legitimate domestic medical 
need, exports, scientific research and 
product development, as well as 
maintaining reserve stocks. In turn, the 
APQ takes into consideration all FDA 
approved dosage forms to meet the 
estimated medical needs of the United 
States. 21 U.S.C. 826(a)(2) provides an 
exception to that general rule by 
allowing, but not requiring, DEA to 
grant quotas in terms of dosage forms if 
DEA determines that doing so will assist 
in avoiding the overproduction, 
shortage, or diversion of controlled 
substances. DEA has utilized this 
authority to issue individual 
manufacturing quotas in terms of dosage 
form when necessary, where it can be 
more effective in averting potential 
shortages. Since quotas set at the 
individual dosage-form manufacturing 
level are more directly connected to 
distributions of FDA-approved drug 
products, DEA can use its dosage-form 
authority to alleviate any potential 
shortage in a more timely manner at the 
individual manufacturing quota level 
than at the aggregate production quota 
level. By issuing a single APQ covering 
all dosage forms of the basic class, 
rather than estimating an APQ for each 
dosage form, DEA retains the flexibility 
to alleviate potential shortages and to 
react to unforeseen emergencies by 
adjusting the individual quotas granted 
to manufacturers under that APQ. 
Data Collection and Methodology 
Issue (Lack of Real-Time Data): A few 
commenters opined that DEA lacks real- 
time data on opioid inventory, 
production and distribution. They 
suggested this lack of real-time data 
makes it difficult for DEA to accurately 
assess legitimate medical needs of 
patients and ensure adequate supply of 
opioid pain medications. 
DEA Response: DEA has access to 
current sales data provided by 
manufacturers from the Quota and Year- 
end Reporting Management System 
(QMS), Automation of Reports and 
Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) 
reports, and monthly IQVIA data when 
determining legitimate medical needs to 
ensure an adequate supply of 
medications containing schedule II- 
controlled substances. While 
manufacturers and distributors have a 
choice on reporting their distributions 
monthly or quarterly under 21 CFR 
1304.33, at the DEA Annual Supply 
Chain Conferences in April 2024 and 
April 2025, DEA requested 
manufacturers and distributors to report 
sales data into the ARCOS database on 
a monthly basis, which improves the 
timeliness and accuracy of data points 
DEA uses to estimate legitimate medical 
needs. 
Issue (over-reliance on historical 
trends): Several commenters opined that the quota-setting process overly relies 
on historical trends that do not 
adequately reflect patient population 
changes and new prescribing trends, 
stating that DEA relies on data that is 
outdated and incomplete, resulting in 
arbitrary cuts to the APQs of opioids 
and suppression of APQs for ADHD 
medications. 
DEA Response: When developing the 
annual APQs, DEA routinely evaluates 
data from multiple sources to ensure 
that all the legal factors specified in 21 
CFR 1303.11(b) are adequately 
addressed. DEA’s quota process not only 
relies on current and historical trends, 
but it also incorporates the most up to 
date information provided by the FDA 
and registered manufacturers. For 
example, DEA utilizes information 
provided by quota applicants to derive 
the estimates of scientific, research, and 
industrial needs, lawful export 
requirements, as well as current reserve 
stocks. The information DEA receives 
from FDA includes the observed and 
projected domestic usage of schedule II- 
controlled substances, new drug 
application and abbreviated new drug 
application approvals, manufacturers 
discontinuing production, product 
shortages, and clinical trials for 
schedule I and II controlled substances. 
FDA utilizes a variety of data sources in 
developing its estimates and describes 
certain caveats regarding the forecasts it 
provides. The data provided by FDA, as 
well as the data obtained from registered 
manufacturers, DEA’s internal 
databases, and third party prescription 
data from IQVIA and MIDAS, all 
contributed to DEA’s proposed APQs to 
meet legitimate estimated domestic 
manufacturing needs for the controlled 
substances listed in the table. 
Diversion Estimates 
Issue (red flags): Commenters raised 
concerns with DEA’s methodology for 
estimating diversion using PDMP ‘‘red 
flags’’ data. Commenters state that the 
data captured in these ‘‘red flags’’ 
metrics can also represent legitimate 
patient care such as changing doctors, 
doctors retiring, multi-specialty care, 
and paying cash due to loss of health 
insurance. 
DEA Response: DEA has worked with 
investigators and subject matter experts 
to select potential indicators of 
diversion. DEA’s Diversion Control 
Division identified over-prescribing, 
doctor shopping, and cash payments as 
risk indicators related to its quota 
setting function. While it is possible that 
a legitimate prescription for an opioid 
might meet one of these criteria, in

legitimate prescriptions would be 
minimal and unlikely to significantly 
impact the diversion calculation. 
Comments From Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers 
Issue (Request for Data Sharing): DEA 
received a comment from a 
pharmaceutical manufacturer stating 
that the data DEA utilizes to determine 
quotas should be shared with 
manufacturers. 
DEA Response: DEA considers 
ARCOS data which is provided by 
registered manufacturers and 
distributors. DEA provides access to 
manufacturers and distributors of this 
data through the use of the ‘‘ARCOS 
lookup’’ tool available to DEA 
registrants on DEA’s website. 
Additionally, DEA cannot provide 
access to the underlying data used in 
calculating the manufacturing, 
procurement, or import quotas because 
it includes confidential business 
information. 
While DEA has stated it considers 
prescription data from IQVIA, a third 
party, DEA purchases this data under 
contract and is not permitted to share 
the data. Any pharmaceutical company 
can contract to purchase data from 
IQVIA or any other company that 
supplies prescription data. 
Issue (APQ adjustment for research): 
DEA received comments from 
pharmaceutical companies regarding 
advanced research and clinical trials of 
several schedule I controlled 
substances, requesting the APQs be 
established at sufficient levels to allow 
for their manufacturing to meet research 
and scientific needs. 
DEA Response: DEA considered these 
comments and matched them to the 
contracted DEA-registered 
manufacturers and determined that the 
specific schedule I controlled substance 
APQs are sufficient to support the 
legitimate research and scientific efforts 
toward an FDA-approved drug product. 
Stakeholder Collaboration 
Issue: Several commenters including palliative care associations and a 
healthcare company suggested that DEA 
should collaborate with a broad range of 
stakeholders on how DEA can address 
the opioid crisis while ensuring 
legitimate medical needs are met. 
DEA Response: DEA has and will 
continue to collaborate with federal 
agencies, industry, and medical 
associations to combat the opioid crisis, 
prevent diversion, and set appropriate 
manufacturing quantities of controlled 
substances and chemicals to meet 
legitimate need and preparedness for 
unforeseen circumstances within the 
United States. In addition, DEA has 
engaged with pharmaceutical 
manufacturers and private sector 
entities with relevant pharmaceutical 
information through roundtable 
discussions and data sharing efforts. 
DEA is willing to meet with relevant 
private organizations upon request 
when presented with good cause. 
Request for Hearing 
Issue: Sixty commenters suggested that DEA consider holding a public 
hearing to provide patient testimony 
regarding the APQs and AANs 
economic impact on public health. 
DEA Response: The decision whether 
to grant a hearing on the issues raised 
by the commenters lies solely within the 
discretion of the Administrator. While 
hearings are required when requested by 
states in certain situations, these 
requests were not submitted by states. 
These requests did not include any 
evidence that would lead to the 
conclusion that a hearing is necessary or 
warranted. DEA appreciates the written 
comments provided by patients and has 
addressed specific points raised by the 
commenters in the issues and responses 
above. 
Comment Period Length 
Issue: DEA received 15 comments questioning why the comment period 
was compressed to 15 calendar days and 
10 comments requesting an extension of 
the comment period. 
DEA Response: The comment period 
was compressed to 15 calendars days in 
part due to the government shutdown 
from October 1 to November 12, 2025. 
DEA provides the opportunity for 
comment on the 2026 proposed APQ 
and AAN as required by 21 CFR 
1303.11(c) and 1315.11(d), which 
establish that the Administrator shall 
permit any interested person to file 
written comments on or objections to 
the proposal and shall designate in the 
notice the time during which such 
filings may be made. 
Out of Scope Comments 
DEA received comments that are 
outside the scope of this order. The 
comments were general in nature and 
included but not limited to issues such 
as specific medical illnesses, medical 
treatments, perceived ineffectiveness of 
suboxone and its potential side effects, 
and medication costs. These comments 
are outside the scope of this Final Order 
and do not impact the analysis involved 
in establishing the 2026 APQs. 
IV. Determination of 2026 Aggregate 
Production Quotas and Assessment of 
Annual Needs 
In determining the established 2026 
APQs and AANs, DEA has considered 
the above comments along with the 
factors set forth in 21 CFR 1303.11 and 
21 CFR 1315.11, in accordance with 21 
U.S.C. 826(a). These factors include, but 
are not limited to, the 2025 
manufacturing quotas, current 2025 
sales and inventories, anticipated 2026 
export requirements, industrial use, 
additional applications for 2026 quotas, 
and information on research and 
product development requirements. 
Schedule I Controlled Substances 
On July 25, 2025, DEA established a 
specific listing for dipentylone in 
schedule I of the Controlled Substances 
Act (CSA) because it is a positional 
isomer of N-ethylpenthylone, which is a 
schedule I hallucinogen (90 FR 38396), 
making all regulatory controls 
pertaining to schedule I controlled 
substances applicable to the 
manufacture of this substance, 
including the requirement to establish 
an aggregate production quota pursuant 
to 21 U.S.C. 826 and 21 CFR part 1303. 
This final order establishes an aggregate 
production quota for this substance. 
On August 15, 2025, DEA published 
a temporary scheduling order placing N- 
pyrrolidino metonitazene and N- 
pyrrolidino protonitazene in schedule I 
of the CSA (90 FR 39314), making all 
regulatory controls pertaining to 
schedule I controlled substances 
applicable to the manufacture of these 
substances, including the requirement 
to establish an aggregate production 
quota pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 826 and 21 
CFR part 1303. This final order 
establishes an aggregate production 
quota for these substances.

establishes an aggregate production 
quota for these substances. 
Schedule II Controlled Substances 
Based on all of the above, the 
Administrator establishes the 2026 
APQs for d, l-amphetamine, d- 
amphetamine (for conversion), 
dimethyltryptamine, lisdexamfetamine, 
morphine (for sale), oripavine,

than were proposed. 
Estimates of Diversion 
As specified in the proposal, and as 
required by 21 U.S.C. 826(i), DEA 
calculated a national diversion estimate 
for each of the five covered controlled 
substances. This data, which remains 
unchanged, was published in the

Self-Regulatory Organizations;

Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of 
Proposed Rule Change To Amend the 
IEX Fee Schedule Concerning Certain 
Connectivity Fees 
December 30, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1)
1
of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’)
2
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
3
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
19, 2025, the Investors Exchange LLC 
(‘‘IEX’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(the ‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I, II and III 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the self-regulatory organization. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 
19(b)(1) under the Act,
4
and Rule 19b– 
4 thereunder,
5
the Exchange is filing 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) a 
proposed rule change to amend its Fee 
Schedule,
6
pursuant to IEX Rules 
15.110(a) and (c), to increase the fee for 
physical connectivity at its Primary Data 
Center, add a fee for physical 
connectivity at the Disaster Recovery 
Data Center, and add a fee for Drop 
Copy logical port fees. Changes to the 
Fee Schedule pursuant to this proposal 
are effective upon filing,
7
and will be 
operative beginning on January 1, 2026. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available at the Exchange’s website at 
https://www.iexexchange.io/resources/ 
regulation/rule-filings and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of 
and basis for the proposed rule change 
and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
The self-regulatory organization has 
prepared summaries, set forth in 
Sections A, B, and C below, of the most 
significant aspects of such statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and the 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
IEX is proposing to amend the 
Connectivity Fees section of its Fee 
Schedule, pursuant to IEX Rules 
15.110(a) and (c), to increase fees for 
physical port connections to its Primary 
Data Center,
8
add a fee for physical port 
connections to its Disaster Recovery 
Data Center,

and add a fee for logical 
Drop Copy Ports.

Member chooses to have ‘‘dropped’’ to another 
destination (e.g., to allow the Member’s back office and/or compliance department, or another 
Member—typically the Member’s clearing broker— 
to have immediate access to the information for risk 
management and other purposes). Drop copies can 
only be sent via a drop copy port. Drop copy ports 
cannot be used to enter orders. 
11
The IEX POP is located at the NY5 data center 
in Secaucus, New Jersey. Physical connectivity is 
provided via network switch and cabling 
infrastructure that allows a subscriber to access a 
logical port to send and receive order messages, as 
well as receive market data messages. 
12
See IEX Rule 11.130(c). 13
See IEX Rule 11.130(d). 14
See IEX Rule 11.130(b). 15
See IEX Rule 11.130(e). 16
See IEX Rule 11.510(a). Service Bureaus offer technology-based services to Members for a fee, 
including physical connectivity and Order Entry 
Ports. Extranet Providers offer physical connectivity 
services to Members and Data Recipients. 
17
Third-party connectivity providers such as 
Service Bureaus and Extranet Providers play an 
important role in expanding access to the Exchange 
and distributing the Exchange’s market data, 
reducing barriers to entry and enabling market 
participants to access the Exchange without the 
need to connect directly. Third-party connectivity 
providers may pass some or all of the connectivity 
fees on to their subscribers, depending on the 
contractual relationship between the parties. The 
Exchange receives no part of the revenue earned by 
third-parties reselling connectivity. 
18
IEX understands that some of the remaining 
20% of Members access the Exchange indirectly 
through other Members. 
19
The proposed fee increase may cause some 
Members, as well as Service Bureaus and Extranet 
Providers, to reduce or eliminate their physical 
connectivity to the Primary Data Center. Further, 
the Service Bureaus and Extranet Providers that 
maintain physical port connectivity to the Exchange 
may increase the fees they charge to Members 
utilizing their connectivity as a result of the 
proposed fee increase. 
20
The ITF can also be accessed free of charge via 
the internet. 
21
The Exchange will continue to offer logical 
order entry ports at the Disaster Recovery Data 
Center free of charge. See IEX Fee Schedule— Connectivity Fees, supra note 6, footnote 3. 22
The Exchange recognizes that instituting a fee 
for connectivity previously provided free of charge 
may cause some Members, as well as Service 
Bureaus and Extranet Providers, to reduce or 
eliminate their physical connectivity to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center. Further, the Service Bureaus 
and Extranet Providers that maintain physical port 
connectivity to the Disaster Recovery Data Center 
may increase the fees they charge to Members 
utilizing their connectivity as a result of the 
proposed fee increase. 
23
See IEX Rule 2.250. 24
In the most recent testing (October 2025), one 
designated Member connected to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center through an Extranet Provider 
for the mandatory testing. 
25
Logical ports provide users with the ability to 
perform specific functions through a connection to 
the Exchange’s System, such as order entry and 
receiving data. Logical connectivity for order entry 
or drop copies is provided via network switch and 
cabling infrastructure at the IEX Primary Data 
Center that delivers order and execution messages, 
as well as server infrastructure that runs software 
processes responsible for validating and formatting 
such messages for either internal or external 
consumption. 
Exchange proposes to increase the 
monthly fees for each physical port 
connection to its Primary Data Center 
from $4,000 to $7,000, which fee would 
continue to include one (1) 10G or 1G 
connection to the ITF free of charge. The 
Exchange also proposes to amend the 
Fee Schedule to begin charging a new 
monthly fee of $3,000 for each physical 
connection to the Disaster Recovery 
Data Center, which the Exchange has 
previously provided free of charge with 
a physical connection to the Primary 
Data Center. In addition, the Exchange 
proposes a new monthly fee of $450 for 
each logical Drop Copy Port, which the 
Exchange currently provides free of 
charge. 
The Exchange proposes to implement 
the changes to the Fee Schedule 
pursuant to this proposal on January 1, 
2026. 
Connectivity Fee Changes 
The Exchange offers the ability to 
physically connect to the Exchange via 
the IEX point-of-presences (the ‘‘IEX 
POP’’)
11
to its Members, Data 
Recipients,
12
Service Bureaus,
13
 
Sponsored Participants,
14
and Extranet 
Providers
15
(collectively, ‘‘Connectivity 
Subscribers’’).
16
Connecting directly to 
the Exchange is optional and not 
required to participate on the Exchange. 
The number of physical connections to 
IEX’s Primary Data Center (via the IEX 
POP) assigned to each Connectivity 
Subscriber is determined by each 
Connectivity Subscriber based on the 
scope and scale of its trading activity on 
the Exchange (or other activity on the 
Exchange, in the case of Data 
Recipients, Service Bureaus, Sponsored 
Participants, and Extranet Providers). As 
of November 1, 2025, 35% of IEX 
Members maintain one or more direct 
physical port connections to the 
Exchange’s Primary Data Center and 
45% of IEX’s Members have physical 
port connectivity to the Exchange 
indirectly through a Service Bureau or 
Extranet Provider
17
rather than 
directly.
18
Thus, the 35% of Members 
with direct physical port connections 
will be subject to the proposed fee 
increase for physical port connectivity 
to the Primary Data Center, assuming no 
changes in the number of direct 
physical port connections maintained 
by such Members.
19
 
The Exchange proposes to increase 
the monthly fee of $4,000 for each 
physical port connection to the Primary 
Data Center (all of which are 10G 
connections) to $7,000, which fee would 
also continue to include an option for 
one (1) 10G or 1G connection to its 
ITF.
20
 
In addition, the Exchange currently 
offers Connectivity Subscribers the 
ability to physically connect to its 
Disaster Recovery Data Center free of 
charge, provided they pay for a direct 
connection to the Primary Data Center. 
The Exchange proposes to introduce a 
monthly fee of $3,000 for each physical 
port connection to the Disaster Recovery 
Data Center.
21
As of November 1, 2025, 
11% of Members maintain at least one 
(1) physical port connection to the 
Disaster Recovery Data Center and 
additional IEX Members have the ability 
to connect to the Disaster Recovery Data 
Center indirectly through a Service 
Bureau or Extranet Provider rather than 
directly. Thus the 11% of Members with 
direct connectivity would be subject to 
the proposed monthly fee of $3,000 per 
physical port connection, assuming no 
changes in the number of physical port 
connections maintained by such 
Members.
22
 
Connecting directly to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center is not mandatory, 
but the Exchange recommends it to 
minimize service disruption in the 
event of an issue at the Primary Data 
Center. Pursuant to IEX Rule 2.250 
(Mandatory Participation in Testing of 
Backup Systems), the Exchange requires 
certain Members who account for a 
meaningful percentage of the 
Exchange’s overall volume to, at least 
once every twelve (12) months, connect 
to the Disaster Recovery Data Center to 
participate in functional and 
performance testing.
23
However, 
Members participating in the mandatory 
testing are not required to purchase a 
direct connection to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center and the Exchange 
permits any designated Member to 
connect through a third-party, such as 
an Extranet Provider, for purposes of the 
mandatory testing.

Similar to other exchanges, the 
Exchange offers Drop Copy Ports for 
receipt of duplicate trade execution 
reports and order messages (which are 
sent via Order Entry Ports). A Drop 
Copy Port is a form of logical port
25
that 
allows subscribers (‘‘Port Subscribers’’) 
to receive, in real time, copies of their 
order flow, which can be configured 
based on various combinations of 
information relating to specific Member 
firms, clearing Market Participant IDs 
(or MPIDs), and/or sessions, according 
to the subscriber’s needs. 
The Exchange currently provides 
Drop Copy Ports free of charge. The 
Exchange proposes to charge $450 for 
each Drop Copy Port per month. This 
proposed fee would not apply to logical

The Exchange recognizes that instituting a fee 
for Drop Copy Ports, previously provided free of 
charge, may cause some Members to reduce or 
eliminate their Drop Copy Ports.

ports used for other purposes, such as 
Order Entry Ports. 
Drop Copy Ports are optional and the 
Exchange does not impose any 
minimum or maximum requirements for 
how many Drop Copy Ports a Port 
Subscriber must maintain, and it is not 
proposing to impose any minimum or 
maximum requirements. Each Port 
Subscriber is free to determine the 
number of Drop Copy Ports it subscribes 
to based on the scope and scale of its 
trading activity on the Exchange, and 
their need for real-time information 
about their trading activity. As of 
November 1, 2025, 28% of Members are 
Drop Copy Port Subscribers and would 
be subject to the proposed monthly fee 
of $450 per Drop Copy Port, assuming 
no changes in the number of direct Drop 
Copy Ports assigned to Members.

Proposed Fees—Additional Discussion 
The Exchange notes that the proposed 
fee changes are designed to enable the 
Exchange to continue to maintain and 
improve its connectivity technology and 
services. The Exchange also notes that 
the proposed fees are within the range 
of, or lower than, the fees charged for 
comparable physical connectivity and 
drop copy ports by other equities 
exchanges with similar or lower market 
share than IEX. 
As proposed, the Exchange will assess 
fees for physical connectivity to the 
Disaster Recovery Data Center and for 
Drop Copy Ports based on the number 
of physical connections to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center and the number of 
Drop Copy Ports assigned to each 
Member or service provider (i.e., Service Bureau and/or Extranet Provider) as of 
the first day of each month. This is 
consistent with the billing methodology 
the Exchange uses to bill for physical 
and logical ports, as reflected in current 
footnotes 1 and 3 to the Connectivity 
Fees table.
27
 
In general, the Exchange believes that 
exchanges, in setting fees of all types, 
should meet very high standards of 
transparency to demonstrate why each 
new fee or fee increase meets the 
Exchange Act requirements. The 
Exchange believes this high standard is 
especially important when an exchange 
imposes fees for market participants to 
access an exchange’s marketplace. As 
discussed further in the Statutory Basis 
section, the Exchange believes the 
proposed fees are reasonable when 
compared with the fees charged by other 
equities exchanges with similar or lower 
market share for physical connectivity 
at their primary and disaster recovery 
data centers and for drop copy ports. 
Further, the Exchange believes that 
the proposed fees—insofar as they 
incentivize Subscribers to consolidate 
their usage of connectivity services or 
discontinue unused connectivity 
subscriptions—will help to encourage a 
more efficient allocation of connectivity 
services usage in a way that aligns with 
the Exchange’s regulatory obligations. 
As a national securities exchange, the 
Exchange is subject to the Regulation 
Systems Compliance and Integrity (‘‘Reg 
SCI’’).
28
Reg SCI Rule 1001(a) requires 
that the Exchange establish, maintain, 
and enforce written policies and 
procedures reasonably designed to 
ensure, among other things, that its Reg 
SCI systems have adequate capacity 
levels to maintain the Exchange’s 
operational capability and promote the 
maintenance of fair and orderly 
markets.
29
By encouraging Users to be 
efficient with their usage of connectivity 
services, the proposed fees will increase 
overall system efficiency and support 
the Exchange’s Reg SCI obligations by 
ensuring that unused application 
sessions are available to be allocated 
based on individual User needs and as 
the Exchange’s overall order and trade 
volumes increase. 
Conforming Changes to Fee Schedule 
As proposed, the Connectivity Fees 
table in the Fee Schedule would be 
amended as follows to reflect the 
proposed fee changes (footnotes 
omitted): 
Service Fee 
10G Physical Port Connection to Primary Data Center ........................... $7,000[4,000] per month. 10G Physical Port Connection to Disaster Recovery Data Center ..........$3,000 per month[Included with 10G Physical Port Connection at Pri-mary Data Center]. 
1G or 10G Physical Port Connection to IEX Test Facility (‘‘ITF’’) ........... Included with 10G Physical Port Connection at Primary Data Center. 
Logical Port (except for Primary Data Center Order Entry Ports and 
Drop Copy Ports).
FREE. 
******* 
Drop Copy Port.........................................................................................$450 per port per month. Because the Exchange will no longer 
provide Disaster Recovery Data Center 
connectivity free of charge, the 
Exchange proposes removing the phrase 
‘‘[i]ncluded with 10G Physical Port 
Connection at Primary Data Center’’ 
from the Fee column. The Exchange also 
proposes revising the parenthetical in 
the Logical Port row of the Connectivity 
Fee table to indicate that Drop Copy 
Ports are excluded from the Logical 
Ports that the Exchange offers free of 
charge. 
In addition, the Exchange proposes to 
amend the footnotes in the Connectivity 
Fees table to state that billing for 
physical connectivity ports for the 
Disaster Recovery Data Center and for 
Drop Copy Ports will be based on the 
number of ports assigned to each 
Member or Service Bureau as of the first 
day of each month. Specifically, the 
Exchange proposes to amend footnote 1 
to reference physical connectivity to the 
Disaster Recovery Data Center as 
follows: 
Physical connectivity fees are billed to and 
payable by the Member, Service Bureau, Data 
Recipient, or Extranet Provider maintaining 
the physical port connection at the Primary 
Data Center or Disaster Recovery Data Center 
based on the number of physical connections 
to each [the Primary] Data Center as of the first of each month. 
The Exchange also proposes to add a 
new footnote 5 to the last row of the 
table, appended to the Drop Copy Port 
row, after the words ‘‘$450 per port per 
month,’’ as follows: 
Fees for Drop Copy Ports are billed to and 
payable by the Member or Service Bureau 
maintaining the port(s) based on the number 
of Drop Copy Ports assigned to each Member 
or Service Bureau as of the first of each 
month.

Implementation 
The Exchange plans to implement the 
proposed fee changes on January 1, 
2026, subject to effectiveness of this 
proposed rule change, in order to 
provide ample advance notice and allow 
impacted market participants time to 
prepare for the changes. On November 
25, 2025, the Exchange announced the 
planned implementation of the 
proposed fees on January 1, 2026, 
subject to the filing and effectiveness of 
an SEC rule filing.
30
 
2. Statutory Basis 
IEX believes that the proposed fees 
are consistent with the provisions of 
Section 6(b)
31
of the Act in general and 
further the objectives of Section 
6(b)(4)
32
of the Act, in particular, in that 
they are designed to provide for the 
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, 
fees and other charges among its 
Members and other persons using its 
facilities. The Exchange also believes 
that the proposed fee changes are 
designed to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and are not designed 
to permit unfair discrimination, 
consistent with the objectives of Section 
6(b)(5)
33
of the Act. The Exchange 
believes the proposed fees are 
reasonable because they will better 
enable the Exchange to continue to 
maintain and improve its connectivity 
services and facilities. In addition, as 
discussed below, the Exchange believes 
the proposed fees are reasonable based 
on a comparison to fees charged by 
other exchanges with similar or lower 
market share for similar connectivity. 
The Proposed Fees Are Reasonable and 
Comparable to the Fees Charged by 
Other Exchanges for Similar 
Connectivity and Ports 
Proposed 10G Physical Port Fee 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed fee of $7,000 per month per 
physical port connection to the Primary 
Data Center is reasonable because it is 
within the range of fees charged for 
comparable physical connectivity by 
other equities exchanges with similar or 
lower market share, and less than fees 
charged for comparable physical 
connectivity by two such exchanges.
34
 
IEX’s year-to-date market share as of 
November 1, 2025 was approximately 
2.86%. Based on publicly available 
information as of November 1, 2025, the 
Exchange compared the proposed fee of 
$7,000 to the fees charged for 
comparable physical connectivity to 
primary data centers by other equities 
exchanges with similar or lower market 
share than IEX. As set forth in the table 
below, the proposed fee of $7,000 is 
lower than the fees charged by Cboe 
BZX and MIAX Pearl Equities for 
physical port connectivity to their 
primary data centers. While Cboe BZX’s 
market share is slightly higher than 
IEX’s, MIAX’s market share is lower. 
IEX notes, however, that the proposed 
fee is higher than the physical port 
connectivity fees charged by MEMX, 
which has a lower market share than 
IEX.

physical connectivity to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center is reasonable 
because it is equal to or less than fees 
charged for comparable physical 
connectivity to disaster recovery data 
centers by other equities exchanges with 
similar or lower market share. As set 
forth in the table below, the proposed 
fee of $3,000 is equivalent to the fees 
charged by MIAX Pearl Equities and 
MEMX for physical connectivity to their 
disaster recovery data centers and IEX’s 
market share is higher than the market 
share of those exchanges. The proposed 
fee is lower than the fee charged by

As discussed above, the types of firms that 
might pay for physical port connectivity to the 
Exchange are: Members, Service Bureaus, Data 
Recipients, Sponsored Participants, and Extranet 
Providers. See supra notes 12 through 15. Drop Copy Port Fee 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed fee of $450 per month per 
Drop Copy Port is reasonable because it 
is equal to or less than fees charged for 
drop copy ports by other equities 
exchanges with similar or lower market 
share. As set forth in the table below, 
the proposed fee of $450 per port is 
lower than the fees charged by Nasdaq 
BX and NYSE Texas, and IEX’s market 
share is higher than the market share of 
those exchanges. The proposed fee is 
equivalent to the fees charged by MIAX 
Pearl Equities, MEMX, and LTSE for 
drop copy ports. IEX’s market share is 
higher than the market share of those 
exchanges. In addition, the proposed fee 
is lower than the fees charged by Cboe 
BZX, although BZX’s market share is 
slightly higher than IEX’s.

Allocated and Not Designed To Permit 
Unfair Discrimination 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposed physical port connectivity fee 
of $7,000 to connect to the Primary Data 
Center, which includes physical port 
connectivity to the ITF for no additional 
charge, and its proposed fee of $3,000 
for physical connectivity to the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center are reasonable, 
fair and equitable, and are not designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
Members because they will apply 
equally to all Members and other 
Connectivity Subscribers
35
that choose 
to purchase direct physical connectivity 
to the Exchange. 
No broker-dealer is required by rule or 
regulation to become a Member of the 
Exchange or to connect directly to the 
Exchange. Further, a direct connection 
to the Exchange is not a requirement to 
participate on the Exchange. The 
proposed fees will apply to all 
Connectivity Subscribers in the same 
manner and are not targeted at a specific 
type or category of market participant 
engaged in any particular trading 
strategy. The proposed fees are not tied 
to volume-based tiers or dependent on 
executing a minimum volume of orders 
on IEX. 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fees are an equitable allocation of 
reasonable fees because they will be 
assessed solely based on the number of 
physical connections a firm selects and 
not on any other distinction applied by 
IEX. Members, Service Bureaus, 
Sponsored Participants, Data Recipients, 
and Extranet Providers can determine 
whether to connect directly to the 
Exchange and if so, the number of 
physical port connections to the 
Primary Data Center and Disaster 
Recovery Data Center they need to 
implement their trading or business 
strategies effectively. The number of 
physical connections to the Exchange 
will continue to be based on individual 
decisions by each firm. The proposed 
fees would enable the Exchange to 
maintain and improve its connectivity 
infrastructure, services, and facilities to 
benefit its customers and remain 
competitive with its peers. If the 
Exchange charges excessive fees, market 
participants are free to either reduce 
connectivity fees by reducing the 
number of physical connections to the 
Exchange or seek more affordable 
alternatives, for example as applicable, 
by participating through a third-party 
connectivity provider. 
In addition, Connectivity Subscribers 
that utilize more physical connectivity 
services typically utilize relatively more 
trading system bandwidth, and thus 
those are the firms that consume the 
most resources from the Exchange. 
Accordingly, the Exchange believes that 
the proposed fees are not designed to 
permit unfair discrimination because 
Connectivity Subscribers with more 
complex connections and which use 
relatively more of the Exchange’s 
capacity and resources pay a higher 
share of the total connectivity services 
fees. 
With respect to Drop Copy Ports, IEX 
believes that its proposed fee is 
reasonable, fair and equitable, and not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination because it will apply 
equally to all Port Subscribers that are 
assigned Drop Copy Ports. In addition, 
Drop Copy Ports are optional; the 
Exchange does not impose any 
minimum or maximum number of Drop 
Copy Ports on Port Subscribers. The 
number of assigned Drop Copy Ports 
will continue to be a function of choices 
made by each Port Subscriber, including 
the ability to reduce fees by 
discontinuing unused Drop Copy Ports. 
All Connectivity Subscribers and Port 
Subscribers will be subject to the same 
fee schedule, regardless of the volume 
sent to or executed on IEX. All 
Members, Service Bureaus, Data 
Recipients, and Extranet Providers will 
pay the same ‘‘per unit’’ rate for 
physical port connectivity to the 
Exchange and for each Drop Copy Port. 
While firms that send relatively more 
inbound messages to IEX may select two 
or more physical connections to the 
Exchange or choose to receive or arrange 
for copies of their message traffic in a 
Drop Copy Port, thereby resulting in 
higher fees, that distinction is based on 
objective differences in usage of port 
connectivity (the result of decisions 
made by each firm) rather than

application of the proposed fees by IEX. 
Moreover, the Exchange believes that it 
is not unfairly discriminatory for Users 
with higher message traffic or more 
complex connections to pay a higher 
share of the total connectivity services 
fees. 
The Exchange also believes that it is 
reasonable, equitable, and not designed 
to permit unfair discrimination to base 
its billing for physical connectivity to 
the Disaster Recovery Data Center and 
for Drop Copy Ports on the number of 
physical connections and Drop Copy 
Ports assigned to Members and Service 
Bureaus as of the first day of each 
month. IEX believes that this approach 
is fair because Members and Service 
Bureaus will have a reasonable 
understanding and expectation of the 
cutoff date for determining whether the 
firm requires one or more physical 
connections to the Disaster Recovery 
Data Center. It is also consistent with 
how the Exchange currently bills for 
physical and order entry ports
36
and 
will therefore align billing for the 
proposed fees with existing billing 
practice, reducing the potential for 
confusion by Members and Service 
Bureaus. 
Furthermore, the Exchange believes 
that the proposed fees are consistent 
with Section 11A of the Exchange Act 
in that they are designed to facilitate the 
economically efficient execution of 
securities transactions, fair competition 
among brokers and dealers, exchange 
markets and markets other than 
exchange markets, and the practicability 
of brokers executing investors’ orders in 
the best market. 
Further, as discussed above, IEX 
believes the proposed fees are 
reasonable because they are equitable 
and not designed to permit unfair 
discrimination, based on a comparison 
to similar fees charged by other 
exchanges. IEX does not believe that 
physical and logical port fees are 
properly constrained by competitive 
market pressures. Nevertheless, the 
Exchange believes that, as discussed 
below, they are not designed to permit 
unfair discrimination. 
In summary, for all of the foregoing 
reasons, the Exchange believes that the 
proposed fees are reasonable, equitably 
allocated, and not designed to permit 
unfair discrimination. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
IEX does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will result in any 
burden on intramarket or intermarket 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on intermarket competition 
that is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
Competing equities exchanges are free 
to propose comparable fee structures 
subject to the SEC rule filing process. 
There is no reason to believe that IEX’s 
proposed fee increases will adversely 
impact any other exchange’s ability to 
compete. And, as discussed in the 
Statutory Basis section, IEX believes 
that a comparison to comparable fees 
charged by competitor markets supports 
that the proposed fees are designed to 
promote fair and non-discriminatory 
intermarket competition. As detailed 
above, the proposed fees are either in 
line with, equal to, or lower than fees 
charged for comparable physical 
connectivity and drop copy ports by 
other exchanges with similar or lower 
market share. Accordingly, the 
Exchange does not believe its proposed 
fee changes impose any burden on 
intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
The Exchange also does not believe 
that the proposed fees will impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
All Connectivity Subscribers and Port 
Subscribers will be charged the same 
amount for each physical connection to 
the Primary Data Center and the Disaster 
Recovery Data Center, and for each 
logical Drop Copy Port. The proposed 
fees do not favor certain categories of 
Connectivity Subscribers or Port 
Subscribers in a manner that would 
impose an undue burden on 
competition. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change would place 
particular Connectivity Subscribers or 
Port Subscribers at the Exchange at a 
relative advantage or disadvantage 
compared to other Connectivity or Port 
Subscribers or affect the ability of such 
firms to compete. The fact that different 
total port fees would be assessed 
depending on the number of ports a 
Subscriber requests is not based on the 
type of Member requesting physical port 
connectivity or Drop Copy Port(s) or 
their trading volume on the Exchange, 
but rather is the result of each 
Subscriber determining the number of 
such ports to request, as discussed in 
the Statutory Basis section. Accordingly, 
the proposed fees for physical 
connectivity services and Drop Copy 
Ports are commensurate with each 
Subscriber’s decision about whether to 
directly connect to the Exchange, how 
many connections it needs, and whether 
it needs copies of its message traffic sent 
to a drop copy port. In addition, the fact 
that Connectivity Subscribers who 
utilize more physical connectivity 
services pay a larger portion of the 
Exchange’s connectivity fees does not 
place those Connectivity Subscribers at 
a competitive disadvantage because 
those Subscribers typically utilize the 
most bandwidth and thus the most 
resources from the Exchange. Thus, for 
the reasons set forth above, the 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed fees will impose any burden 
on intramarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
As described in the Purpose section, 
the proposed fee changes arguably 
promote both intermarket and 
intramarket competition by assisting the 
Exchange in complying with its 
Regulation SCI compliance obligations 
to have capacity levels adequate to 
maintain IEX’s operational capability 
and promote the maintenance of fair 
and orderly markets, thereby enabling 
IEX to support a robust trading 
environment for its Members and 
compete with other equities exchange 
venues.

Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others

III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A)(ii)
37
of the Act. 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission shall institute proceedings 
under Section 19(b)(2)(B)

of the Act to 
determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed 
Rule Change To Amend Rules Related 
to Processing of Auction Responses 
and Length of Auction Timers 
December 30, 2025. 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),

and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
23, 2025, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I and II below, which Items have 
been prepared by the Exchange. The 
Exchange filed the proposal as a ‘‘non- 
controversial’’ proposed rule change 
pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of 
the Act

and Rule 19b–4(f)(6) 
thereunder.

The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to extend the 
sunset date for certain functionality 
relating to the processing of auction 
responses to June 30, 20256 [sic] and 
reduce the maximum length of auction 
periods for certain auction mechanisms 
to 1000 milliseconds. The text of the 
proposed rule change is available on the 
Commission’s website (https://
www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml), the 
Exchange’s website (https://
www.cboe.com/us/options/regulation/ 
rule_filings/bzx/), and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange currently offers a 
variety of auction mechanisms which 
provide price improvement 
opportunities for eligible orders. 
Particularly, the Exchange offers the 
following auction mechanisms: 
Complex Order Auction (‘‘COA’’),
5
Step 
Up Mechanism (‘‘SUM’’),
6
Automated 
Improvement Mechanism (‘‘AIM’’),
7
 
Complex AIM (‘‘C–AIM’’),
8
Solicitation 
Auction Mechanism (‘‘SAM’’),
9
and 
Complex SAM (‘‘C–SAM’’).
10
The 
Exchange notes that eligible orders 
(‘‘auctioned orders’’) are electronically 
exposed for an Exchange-determined 
period (collectively referred to herein as 
‘‘auction response period’’) in 
accordance with the applicable 
Exchange Rule, during which time 
Users may submit responses 
(collectively referred to herein as 
‘‘auction responses’’ or ‘‘auction 
response messages’’) to an auction 
message. 
In June 2023, in order to provide 
responses to these auctions with 
increased opportunities to participate in 
the auction, even during periods of high 
message traffic, and thus potentially 
provide customers with additional 
opportunities for price improvement, 
the Exchange adopted new functionality 
that applies across all of its auction 
mechanisms to increase the likelihood 
that timely submitted auction responses 
may participate in the applicable 
auction, even during periods of high 
message traffic.
11
Under this 
functionality, at the time an auction 
response period ends, the System 
continues to process its inbound queue 
for any messages that were received by 
the System before the end of the auction 
period (including auction responses) for 
up to an Exchange-determined period of 
time, not to exceed 100 milliseconds 
(which the Exchange may determine on 
a class-by-class basis which would 
apply to all auction mechanisms and 
which would be announced with 
reasonable advanced notice via 
Exchange Notice).
12
That is, any auction 
responses that were in the queue before 
the conclusion of the auction (as 
identified by the Network Interface Card 
(‘‘NIC’’) timestamp on the message) 
would be processed as long as the 
Exchange-determined time on a class-

(SR–CBOE–2025–031). The Exchange currently lists 
SPX options on a group basis pursuant to Rule 
4.13(f), with a.m.-settled SPX options trading under 
symbol SPX and p.m.-settled SPX options trading 
under symbol SPXW. Pursuant to Rule 1.5(c), this 
rule applies to both groups.

Current lengths of auction response and 
exposure periods are available at cboe_options_product_configurations.xlsx. The COA and AIM/C– AIM auction response periods are currently set to 
100 milliseconds for SPX options (other auctions 
are not currently activated for SPX).

As discussed below, the Exchange proposes to 
reduce the maximum length of the AIM auction 
period to one second (i.e., 1000 milliseconds). 16

The shortest amount of the maximum buffer 
used on a trading day was nearly 700 milliseconds 
since May 12, 2025. 
by-class basis (not to exceed 100 
milliseconds) is not exceeded. Only 
auction responses received prior to the 
execution of the applicable auction are 
eligible to be processed for that auction. 
The applicable auction will execute 
once all messages, including auction 
responses, received before the end time 
of the auction response period have 
been processed or the Exchange- 
determined maximum time limit of up 
to 100 milliseconds has elapsed, 
whichever occurs first. This 
continuation of processing the queue for 
an additional amount of time for 
messages that were received before the 
end of the auction allows for auction 
responses that would otherwise have 
been canceled due to the conclusion of 
the auction response period to still have 
an opportunity to participate in the 
auction. 
In April 2025, the Exchange proposed 
to increase the permissible maximum 
length of this Exchange-determined time 
period with respect to SPX options.
13
 
Specifically, the Exchange amended 
Rule 5.25(c) to provide that with respect 
to SPX options, this Exchange- 
determined period of time for this 
continuation of auction response 
processing plus the length of the auction 
response or exposure period, as 
applicable,
14
may not exceed 1000 
milliseconds (which the Exchange will 
continue to announce with reasonable 
advance notice via Exchange Notice). 
For example, Rule 5.37(c)(3) permits the 
Exchange to determine the length of the 
AIM auction period, which may be no 
less than 100 milliseconds and currently 
no more than three seconds (i.e., 3000 milliseconds).
15
Currently, the 
Exchange has set the length of the AIM 
auction period as 100 milliseconds for 
SPX options and the length of the 
auction response processing time as 900 
milliseconds. 
The Rules currently provide that after 
December 31, 2025, the maximum 
length of this Exchange-determined 
period of time for this continuation of 
auction response processing for SPX 
will revert back to 100 milliseconds. 
The Exchange proposes to extend the 
sunset date to June 30, 2026. The 
Exchange believes extension of the 
sunset date for the maximum amount of 
additional time for processing will 
continue to result in more auction 
responses being executed in auctions for 
SPX options, particularly in times of 
high message traffic. 
The Exchange also proposes to amend 
Rules 5.33(d)(3), 5.37(c)(3), and 
5.38(c)(3) to reduce the maximum 
length of the COA response time 
interval, AIM auction period, and C– 
AIM Auction period, respectively, to 
one second from three seconds. This is 
consistent with the maximum time 
period for SPX options set forth in Rule 
5.25(c) described above. Specifically, 
with respect to SPX options, the longest 
an auction period could be under Rule 
5.25(c) is 1000 milliseconds if the 
auction response processing time is 
zero. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change is consistent with the Act 
and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
16
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Section 
6(b)(5)
17
requirements that the rules of 
an exchange be designed to prevent 
fraudulent and manipulative acts and 
practices, to promote just and equitable 
principles of trade, to foster cooperation 
and coordination with persons engaged 
in regulating, clearing, settling, 
processing information with respect to, 
and facilitating transactions in 
securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
18
requirement that 
the rules of an exchange not be designed 
to permit unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
the proposed rule change will remove 
impediments to a free and open market, 
as it will allow the Exchange’s System 
to continue to process nearly all timely 
submitted auction responses for SPX 
options auctions, particularly in times 
of volatility and high message traffic. 
The sunset period permitted the 
Exchange to evaluate whether a longer 
auction response processing time would 
continue to be appropriate in times of 
high volatility. The Exchange believes 
that to be the case, as it has proposed 
to make this longer auction response 
processing time permanent (and 
applicable to all classes rather than just 
SPX options).
19
In support of this 
proposal to extend the sunset date, in 
2025 prior to May 12, 2025 (the date on 
which the Exchange implemented the 
longer auction processing response time 
for SPX options), the percentage of 
auction responses in SPX that were 
received by the System before the end 
of the auction period (i.e., had received a NIC timestamp) but were rejected 
because the Exchange could not process 
them before the end of the auction 
response or exposure period, as 
applicable, plus shorter buffer time, 
reached over 20% on several occasions 
and averaged approximately 7.64%. 
Between May 12 and December 4, 2025, 
this percentage was nearly 0 (the 
maximum percentage of rejected auction 
responses on a trading day during this 
timeframe was 0.03%). Therefore, the 
data demonstrates that the longer 
auction response processing time has 
resulted in the System’s ability to 
process nearly all timely submitted 
auction responses for SPX options. 
Despite the maximum auction 
response processing time being 900 
milliseconds, the daily average length of 
the auction response processing time 
used between May 12 and December 4, 
2025, has been below 100 milliseconds 
on all but four trading days. However, 
the maximum 900 millisecond buffer 
has been necessary for auctions on all 
but 15 trading days (approximately 90% 
of trading days) during that time 
period.
20
Therefore, as expected, in the 
vast majority of cases, the additional 
time needed after the conclusion of an 
auction response period, if any, to 
process all pending auction responses is 
significantly shorter than the proposed 
maximum, but the longer maximum 
time has been beneficial during times of 
high message traffic and volatility. This 
is a further benefit of being able to 
increase the length of the auction 
response processing time rather than the 
length of an auction response period. 
Unlike an auction response period, 
which must run in its entirety, the 
auction response processing is 
adaptable. For example, if the System is 
‘‘caught up’’ and processes all auction 
responses received prior to the 
completion of a 100 millisecond auction 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00077 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES305 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 21
To the extent the Exchange determines a lesser 
amount of time would be sufficient for SPX options, 
the Exchange could implement an additional 
amount of time for processing auction responses 
that is less than the combined time of 1000 
milliseconds, which time would be announced with 
reasonable advance notice to market participants 
via Exchange Notice. The Exchange generally gives 
notice one to two weeks in advance of 
implementation for changes such as this; however, 
shorter notice may be provided if the Exchange 
believes it is necessary to maintain fair and orderly 
markets. 
22
The Exchange has undertaken various steps to 
improve the performance (including to reduce 
latency) of the matching engine on which SPX 
trades. For example, the Exchange has made various 
hardware and software upgrades. See, e.g., 
Exchange Notice C2025112400, Cboe C1 Options 
Exchange Matching Engine Enhancements 
(November 24, 2025), available at Cboe C1 Options 
Exchange Matching Engine Enhancements. The 
Exchange continues to evaluate other potential 
means that may improve performance and reduce 
latency for SPX and all options. The extended 
sunset period will permit the Exchange to continue 
to evaluate whether a longer auction response 
processing time will continue to be appropriate in 
times of high volatility and message traffic and 
continue to pursue permanent approval of the 
longer auction response processing time for SPX 
and all options. 
23
See, e.g., MIAX Rules 5.15A(a)(2)(i)(C) 
(maximum auction period of one second for MIAX 
Price Improvement Mechanism (‘‘PRIME’’) 
(including PRIME for complex orders, pursuant to 
Interpretation and Policy .12 of that rule), which is 
similar to AIM); and 5.18(d)(3) (maximum auction 
period of 500 milliseconds for the complex order 
auction).

25
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). In addition, Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6)(iii) requires a self-regulatory organization to 
give the Commission written notice of its intent to 
file the proposed rule change, along with a brief 
description and text of the proposed rule change, 
at least five business days prior to the date of filing 
of the proposed rule change, or such shorter time 
as designated by the Commission. The Exchange 
has satisfied this requirement.

response period within 50 milliseconds 
after the end of the auction period, the 
total processing time would be 150 
milliseconds. The System only uses the 
portion of the auction response 
processing time it needs to process 
responses with timestamps prior to the 
end of the auction period (and uses no 
part of that time if unnecessary to do 
so).
21
 
Given the significantly reduced 
number of auction responses that have 
been rejected during the time period 
since the 900 millisecond auction 
processing time was implemented, and 
thus the significant number of auction 
responses that have been able to 
participate in auctions rather than be 
rejected, the Exchange believes the 
proposed rule change will permit the 
Exchange to leave this functionality in 
place without disruption to market 
participants to the benefit of investors. 
The Exchange believes the longer 
auction response processing time for 
SPX options continues to appropriately 
balance providing investors with timely 
processing of their SPX options quote 
and order messages and providing 
investors who submit SPX orders that 
are auctioned with additional liquidity. 
The extension of the sunset date will 
allow more investors additional 
opportunities to receive price 
improvement through an auction 
mechanism for their SPX orders. 
Further, the Exchange believes the 
extension of the sunset date will result 
in increased execution opportunities for 
liquidity providers that submit auction 
responses and enhance the potential for 
price improvement for SPX orders 
submitted to each mechanism to the 
benefit of investors and public 
interest.
22
 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
rule change to reduce the maximum 
length of the auction periods for COA, 
AIM, and C–AIM will remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system, and, in 
general, to protect investors and the 
public interest, as it will bring 
consistency among the Exchange’s 
Rules. Specifically, as noted above, 
despite the Rules providing that the 
Exchange could set the length of COA, 
AIM, and C–AIM auctions as high as 
3000 milliseconds, practically, under 
Rule 5.25(c), for SPX options, those 
auctions could be no higher than 1000 
milliseconds. Additionally, given the 
increased speeds of electronic trading, a 
three-second auction is no longer 
practical. Each of these three auctions is 
currently set to 100 milliseconds, and 
the Exchange has no intention of 
needing to have an auction last more 
than one second. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. The 
Exchange does not believe that the 
proposed rule change will impose any 
burden on intramarket competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act, 
as the proposed extension of the sunset 
date, and thus continuation of a 
permissible 900 milliseconds of 
additional auction response processing, 
would apply equally to all Trading 
Permit Holders that submit auction 
responses in SPX options. Additionally, 
the length of any COA, AIM, or C–AIM 
auction (even with a reduced maximum 
length of one second from three 
seconds) will apply in the same manner 
to all Trading Permit Holders. The 
Exchange does not believe the proposed 
rule change will impose any burden on 
intermarket competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act, as the 
proposed rule change maintains 
functionality related to the processing of 
auction responses that may only 
participate in auctions that occur on the 
Exchange. With respect to the maximum 
length of auction timers, the proposed 
maximum length is consistent with the 
maximum auction period for 
comparable auction on other option 
exchanges.
23
 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received written comments on the 
proposed rule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Because the foregoing proposed rule 
change does not: (i) significantly affect 
the protection of investors or the public 
interest; (ii) impose any significant 
burden on competition; and (iii) become 
operative for 30 days from the date on 
which it was filed, or such shorter time 
as the Commission may designate, it has 
become effective pursuant to Section 
19(b)(3)(A) of the Act
24
and Rule 19b– 
4(f)(6) thereunder.
25
 
A proposed rule change filed under 
Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
26
normally does not 
become operative prior to 30 days after 
the date of the filing. However, pursuant 
to Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii),
27
the 
Commission may designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange has asked the 
Commission to waive the 30-day 
operative delay so that the proposed 
rule change may become operative upon 
filing. Under current CBOE rules, after 
December 31, 2025, the maximum 
length of the auction response 
processing time for non-FLEX SPX 
options would revert back to 100 
milliseconds from the current threshold 
of 1000 milliseconds. The Exchange 
proposes to extend this sunset date to 
June 30, 2026 and, according to the 
Exchange, waiver of the operative delay 
will benefit investors because it will 
permit the Exchange to retain this

30
For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has considered the

and capital formation. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). 31

functionality without interruption to the 
market. 
With respect to the proposed decrease 
the maximum length of COA, AIM, and 
C–AIM auction periods, the Exchange 
stated that under the proposed rule 
change, these auctions will continue to 
function as they do today, as the length 
of the auction periods for each of these 
auctions is currently 100 milliseconds, 
well below the proposed maximum of 
1000 milliseconds.
28
The Exchange also 
observed that the proposed maximum of 
1000 milliseconds is consistent with the 
practical maximum time imposed by 
Rule 5.25(c) for SPX options. 
The proposed rule change provides a 
temporary extension of the existing 
auction response processing time for 
non-FLEX SPX options while the 
Exchange concurrently seeks to make 
the rule permitting the longer auction 
response processing time for these 
options permanent,
29
decreases the 
maximum length of COA, AIM, and C– 
AIM auction periods in a manner that 
allows these auctions to continue to 
operate as they do today without 
disruption to market participants, and 
raises no novel regulatory issues. 
Therefore, waiver of the 30-day 
operative delay is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. Accordingly, the Commission 
hereby waives the operative delay and 
designates the proposal operative upon 
filing.
30
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved.

Schedule 
December 30, 2025 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4 thereunder,
2
 
notice is hereby given that on December 
18, 2025, Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the 
‘‘Exchange’’ or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) filed 
with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change as described in 
Items I, II, and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the Exchange. 
The Commission is publishing this 
notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Cboe Exchange, Inc. (the ‘‘Exchange’’ 
or ‘‘Cboe Options’’) proposes to amend 
the Silexx fee schedule to remove all 
fees and references to the Silexx FLEX 
platform, remove the data management 
fee waiver for Cboe Silexx, and update 
language regarding the first month fee 
waiver for Cboe Silexx to address mid- 
month subscription start dates. The text 
of the proposed rule change is provided 
in Exhibit 5. 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is also available on the Commission’s 
website (https://www.sec.gov/rules/ 
sro.shtml), the Exchange’s website 
(https://www.cboe.com/us/options/

II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend the 
Silexx fee schedule, effective December 
1, 2025. By way of background, the 
Exchange originally offered the 
following versions of the Silexx 
platform: Basic, Pro, Pro Plus Risk and 
Buy-Side Manager (‘‘Legacy Platforms’’). 
The Legacy Platforms were designed so 
that a User could enter orders into the 
platform to send to the executing broker, 
including Trading Permit Holders 
(TPHs), of its choice with connectivity 
to the platform. Users could not directly 
route orders through any of the Legacy 
Platforms to an exchange or trading

center nor was the platform integrated 
into or directly connected to Cboe 
Option’s System. In 2019, the Exchange 
made available a new version of the 
Silexx platform, Silexx FLEX, which 
supported the trading of FLEX Options 
and allowed authorized Users direct 
access to the Exchange to establish 
connectivity and submit orders directly 
to the Exchange.
3
In 2020, the Exchange 
made an additional version of the Silexx 
platform available, Cboe Silexx, which 
originally only supported the trading of 
non-FLEX Options and allowed 
authorized Users direct access to the 
Exchange to establish connectivity and 
submit orders directly to the Exchange.
4
 
In August of 2025, the Exchange 
transitioned the Legacy Platforms to the 
current version of Cboe Silex,
5
and no 
longer offers access to the Legacy 
Platforms, including Silexx FLEX.
6
 
Additionally, the current version of 
Cboe Silexx, includes the functionality 
of both the original Cboe Silexx and 
Silexx FLEX platforms. As such, the risk 
of duplicative fees no longer exists. 
Accordingly, the Exchange proposes to 
remove the data management fee waiver 
from the Silexx fee schedule.
7
 
The Exchange has an established fee 
structure for the Cboe Silexx platform, 
based on Login IDs and set forth in the 
Silexx fee schedule. For the Cboe Silexx 
platform, there is a monthly fee of $399 
per Login ID for the first 16 Login IDs 
(i.e., Logins Ids 1–16), a fee of $299 per each additional Login ID for the next 16 
Login IDs (i.e., Login IDs 17–32), and each Login ID thereafter is $199 per 
Login ID (i.e., 33+ Login IDs). The Exchange’s fee schedule currently 
displays fees for Silexx FLEX as an 
independent platform. As Silexx FLEX 
is no longer offered as a separate 
platform from Cboe Silexx, the 
Exchange proposes to remove all 
references to the Silexx FLEX platform 
from its fee schedule. 
Additionally, the Exchange proposes 
to remove the current data management 
fee waiver in place for both Silexx FLEX 
and Cboe Silexx. The Exchange’s fee 
schedule includes a data management 
charge of $20 per month per Login ID. 
However, the Exchange implemented a 
fee waiver for the data management 
charge while transitioning the Legacy 
Platforms to the Cboe Silexx platform.
8
 
The purpose of the waiver was to avoid 
duplicative fees for Users who had 
access to both the old Legacy Platforms 
and the new version of Cboe Silexx .
9
 
As discussed above, the transition of the 
Legacy Platforms to the current version 
of Cboe Silexx, which includes the 
functionality of both the original Cboe 
Silexx and Silexx FLEX platforms, is 
complete, and Users only have access to 
the new version of Cboe Silexx. Thus, 
the risk of duplicative fees no longer 
exists. Accordingly, the Exchange 
proposes to remove the data 
management fee waiver from the Silexx 
fee schedule. 
Finally, the Exchange notes that the 
Silexx fee schedule currently states that 
the fee for access to both Silexx FLEX 
and Cboe Silexx is waived for the first 
month for any new user firm and that 
the fee for access to Cboe Silexx is 
waived for any new individual user. 
Moreover, the Exchange further notes 
that the current fee schedule does not 
address the duration of the fee waiver if 
a new user firm or individual user 
begins their first month subscription on 
a day other than the first of the calendar 
month. 
As noted above, the Exchange no 
longer offers access to Silexx FLEX as a 
standalone product because Cboe Silexx 
now offers the same functionality. As 
such, the Exchange now proposes to 
update the Silexx fee schedule to 
remove any references to Silexx FLEX, 
including the the Silexx FLEX fee 
waiver, as well as the removal of the 
data management fee waiver. The 
Exchange also seeks to amend the fee 
schedule to clarify that Cboe Silexx will 
not prorate monthly billing. As such, 
any fee waiver for the first month of 
access to Cboe Silexx applies to the 
calendar month in which the 
subscription begins and may apply for 
less than 30 days depending on the start 
date of the subscription. 
As a result, the removal of the 
monthly fee proration will result in new 
Cboe Silexx users who subscribe to the 
platform mid-month from being 
assessed a full month’s fees, whereas 
they previously were charged on a 
prorated basis when subscribing on a 
day that is not the first business day of 
the month. Furthermore, while the 
Exchange is removing the Silexx fee 
waivers and data management fee 
waivers, the Exchange notes that such 
waivers are no longer necessary given 
that the transition from the Legacy 
Platforms to the new Cboe Silexx has 
been completed, eliminating the risk of 
duplicative billing that existed during 
the transition period. 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes the proposed 
fee schedule changes are consistent with 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 
‘‘Act’’) and the rules and regulations 
thereunder applicable to the Exchange 
and, in particular, the requirements of 
Section 6(b) of the Act.
10
Specifically, 
the Exchange believes the proposed fee 
schedule changes are consistent with 
the Section 6(b)(5)
11
requirements that 
the rules of an exchange be designed to 
prevent fraudulent and manipulative 
acts and practices, to promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, to foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, to remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system, and, in general, to protect 
investors and the public interest. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
proposed fee schedule changes are 
consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)
12
 
requirement that the rules of an 
exchange not be designed to permit 
unfair discrimination between 
customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Exchange also believes the 
proposed fee schedule changes are 
consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the 
Act, which requires that Exchange rules 
provide for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees, and other charges 
among its Trading Permit Holders and 
other persons using its facilities. 
In particular, the Exchange believes 
the proposed changes to the Silexx fee 
schedule are reasonable, equitable, and 
not unfairly discriminatory because the 
proposed changes will apply to equally 
to all Users of Cboe Silexx. The 
proposed removal of all fees and 
references to the Silexx FLEX platform 
seeks to align the fee schedule with the 
current Cboe Silexx platform, which

15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A). 
14
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f). 
now includes the functionality of Silexx 
FLEX. The Exchange believes this 
proposed change is reasonable, 
equitable, and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the change 
ensures consistent pricing for Silexx 
services for all Users of FLEX and non- 
FLEX products, which have now been 
integrated into a single platform, Cboe 
Silexx. 
Similarly, the removal of the data 
management fee waiver reinstates a fee 
originally waived to ensure no 
duplicative charges were assessed upon 
Users of both the Legacy Platforms and 
the Cboe Silexx platform during the 
wind down of the Legacy Platforms and 
transition to current version of Cboe 
Silexx. The Exchange no longer offers 
access to the Legacy Platforms and 
therefore no risk of duplicative charges 
remains. Thus, the Exchange believes 
the removal of the data management fee 
waiver is reasonable and equitable. 
Additionally, the Exchange believes the 
data management fee is reasonable as it 
accounts for administrative costs that 
Cboe Silexx incurs, but does not charge 
Users, to maintain and support all Cboe 
Silexx offerings. The removal of the data 
management fee waiver is not unfairly 
discriminatory because the fee will 
apply to all Users equally, in that all 
Users will be subject to the data 
management fee. 
Finally, the proposed change to the 
Silexx fee schedule to clarify the terms 
of the fee waiver for use of Cboe Silexx 
is reasonable and promotes just and 
equitable principles of trade because the 
change seeks to clarify the terms of the 
one-month fee waiver for Cboe Silexx. 
The proposed change clarifies the terms 
of the one-month fee waiver of Cboe 
Silexx by describing that the fee waiver 
applies only for the calendar month in 
which the subscription began and 
therefore may be for less than 30 days 
because Cboe Silexx does not prorate 
monthly billing. Additionally, the 
proposed change is not unfairly 
discriminatory because it applies 
equally to all new users of the Cboe 
Silexx in that no new User will be 
entitled to a prorated monthly fee or a 
fee waiver outside of the calendar 
month in which the subscription to 
Cboe Silexx began. The Exchange 
believes that by increasing the 
consistency and clarity of the Cboe 
Silexx fee schedule, the proposed 
changes promote just and equitable 
principles of trade and remove 
impediments to and perfect the 
mechanism of a free and open market 
and a national market system. 
Finally, the Exchange notes that use 
of the Cboe Silexx is discretionary and 
not compulsory, as Users can choose to 
route orders, including to Cboe Options, 
without the use of the Cboe Silexx. 
Indeed, Cboe Silexx is not an exclusive 
means of trading, and if market 
participants believe that other products, 
vendors, front-end builds, etc. available 
in the marketplace are more beneficial 
or cost effective than Cboe Silexx, they 
may simply use those products instead, 
including for routing orders to the 
Exchange, indirectly or directly. The 
Exchange makes Cboe Silexx available 
as a convenience to market participants, 
who will continue to have the option to 
use any order entry and management 
system available in the marketplace to 
send orders to the Exchange and other 
exchanges; the platforms are merely 
alternatives offered by the Exchange. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed fee schedule changes will 
impose any burden on competition that 
is not necessary or appropriate in 
furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 
The proposed fee schedule changes will 
not impose any burden on intramarket 
competition that are not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act because the 
proposed changes will apply to 
similarly situated participants 
uniformly, as described above. 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed fee schedule changes will 
impose any burden on intermarket 
competition that is not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act because the 
proposed changes apply only to Cboe 
Options. Additionally, Cboe Silexx is 
similar to types of products that are 
widely available throughout the 
industry, at similar prices. Further, the 
proposed fee schedule changes relate to 
an optional platform. As discussed, the 
use of the platform continues to be 
completely voluntary and market 
participants will continue to have the 
flexibility to use any entry and 
management tool that is proprietary or 
from third-party vendors, and/or market 
participants may choose any executing 
brokers to enter their orders. Cboe 
Silexx is not an exclusive means of 
trading, and if market participants 
believe that other products, vendors, 
front-end builds, etc. available in the 
marketplace are more beneficial than 
Cboe Silexx, they may simply use those 
products instead, including for routing 
orders to the Exchange, indirectly or 
directly. Use of the functionality is 
completely voluntary. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
The Exchange neither solicited nor 
received comments on the proposed fee 
schedule change. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
The foregoing rule change has become 
effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) 
of the Act
13
and paragraph (f) of Rule 
19b–4
14
thereunder. At any time within 
60 days of the filing of the proposed rule 
change, the Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. If the 
Commission takes such action, the 
Commission will institute proceedings 
to determine whether the proposed rule 
change should be approved or 
disapproved. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to

arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

A dividend strategy is defined as transactions 
done to achieve a dividend arbitrage involving the 
purchase, sale and exercise of in-the-money options 
of the same class, executed the first business day 
prior to the date on which the underlying stock goes 
ex-dividend. See Options 7, Section 4. 4
A merger strategy is defined as transactions 
done to achieve a merger arbitrage involving the 
purchase, sale and exercise of options of the same 
class and expiration date, executed the first 
business day prior to the date on which 
shareholders of record are required to elect their 
respective form of consideration, i.e., cash or stock. See Options 7, Section 4. 5
A short stock interest strategy is defined as 
transactions done to achieve a short stock interest 
arbitrage involving the purchase, sale and exercise 
of in-the-money options of the same class. See 
Options 7, Section 4.

Reversal and conversion strategies are 
transactions that employ calls and puts of the same 
strike price and the underlying stock. Reversals are 
established by combining a short stock position 
with a short put and a long call position that shares 
the same strike and expiration. Conversions employ 
long positions in the underlying stock that 
accompany long puts and short calls sharing the 
same strike and expiration. See Options 7, Section 4.

A jelly roll strategy is defined as transactions 
created by entering into two separate positions 
simultaneously. One position involves buying a put 
and selling a call with the same strike price and 
expiration. The second position involves selling a 
put and buying a call, with the same strike price, 
but with a different expiration from the first 
position. See Options 7, Section 4. 8
A box spread strategy is a strategy that 
synthesizes long and short stock positions to create 
a profit. Specifically, a long call and short put at 
one strike is combined with a short call and long 
put at a different strike to create synthetic long and 
synthetic short stock positions, respectively. See 
Options 7, Section 4.

Of note, NDX, NDXP, and XND Options 
Transactions are excluded from strategy cap 
pricing.

See Phlx’s Pricing Schedule at Options 7, Section 4. A Floor Qualified Contingent Cross Order 
is comprised of an originating order to buy or sell 
at least 1,000 contracts that is identified as being 
part of a qualified contingent trade coupled with a 
contra-side order or orders totaling an equal number 
of contracts. The term ‘‘qualified contingent trade’’ 
shall have the same meaning set forth in Options 
3, Section 12(a)(3). See Options 8, Section 30(e). 11
The term ‘‘Lead Market Maker’’ applies to 
transactions for the account of a Lead Market Maker 
(as defined in Options 2, Section 12(a)). A Lead 
Market Maker is an Exchange member who is

or ‘‘SQT’’ is defined in Options 1, Section 1(b)(55) 
as a Market Maker who has received permission 
from the Exchange to generate and submit option 
quotations electronically in options to which such 
SQT is assigned. The term ‘‘Remote Streaming 
Quote Trader’’ or ‘‘RSQT’’ is defined in Options 1, 
Section 1(b)(49) as a Market Maker that is a member 
affiliated with an RSQTO with no physical trading 
floor presence who has received permission from 
the Exchange to generate and submit option 
quotations electronically in options to which such 
RSQT has been assigned. A Remote Streaming 
Quote Trader Organization or ‘‘RSQTO,’’ which 
may also be referred to as a Remote Market Making 
Organization (‘‘RMO’’), is a member organization in 
good standing that satisfies the RSQTO readiness 
requirements in Options 2, Section 1(a). See 
Options 7, Section 1(c). 
13

change as described in Items I, II, and 
III, below, which Items have been 
prepared by the Exchange. The 
Commission is publishing this notice to 
solicit comments on the proposed rule 
change from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
Options 7, Section 4, Multiply Listed 
Options Fees (Includes options 
overlying equities, ETFs, ETNs and 
indexes which are Multiply Listed) 
(Excludes SPY and broad-based index 
options symbols listed within Options 
7, Section 5.A). 
The text of the proposed rule change 
is available on the Exchange’s website at 
https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/ 
rulebook/phlx/rulefilings, and at the principal office of the Exchange. 
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
Exchange included statements 
concerning the purpose of and basis for 
the proposed rule change and discussed 
any comments it received on the 
proposed rule change. The text of these 
statements may be examined at the 
places specified in Item IV below. The 
Exchange has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
Phlx proposes to amend pricing 
within Options 7, Section 4 with respect 
to strategy caps for Floor Originated 
Strategy Executions. 
Today, the Exchange permits the 
following strategy executions: (1) 
dividend strategy,
3
merger strategy,
4
 
short stock interest strategy,
5
reversal 
and conversion strategies,
6
jelly roll 
strategy,
7
and a box spread strategy.
8
To 
qualify for a strategy cap,
9
the buy and 
sell side of a transaction must originate 
either from the Exchange Trading Floor 
or as a Floor Qualified Contingent Cross 
Order.
10
Currently, in lieu of the 
Options Transactions Charges in 
Options 7, Section 4 for Penny Symbols 
and Non-Penny Symbols, the Exchange 
pays a $0.01 rebate per contract on any 
strategy execution that meets the 
qualifications noted in the table in 
Options 7, Section 4. Therefore, for a 
dividend strategy, a Lead Market

trading day in the same class of options 
when such members are trading: (1) in 
their own proprietary accounts; or (2) on 
an agency basis, is paid a $0.01 rebate 
per contract. For a merger, short stock 
interest and box spread strategy, a Lead 
Market Maker, Market Maker, 
Professional, Firm and Broker-Dealer 
that executed on the same trading day 
for all classes of options in the aggregate 
when such members are trading (1) in 
their own proprietary accounts; or (2) on 
an agency basis, is paid a $0.01 rebate 
per contract. Finally, for reversal and 
conversion and jelly roll strategies, a 
Lead Market Maker, Market Maker, 
Professional, Firm and Broker-Dealer 
that executed on the same trading day 
for all classes of options in the aggregate 
when such members are trading (1) in 
their own proprietary accounts; or (2) on 
an agency basis, is paid a $0.01 rebate 
per contract. Finally, Customers are not 
assessed a fee and do not receive a 
rebate for strategy transactions. 
Proposal 
At this time, the Exchange proposes to 
remove the $0.01 strategy rebates 
described in the table at Options 7, 
Section 4 and instead assess no 
transaction charges on any permissible 
strategy executions defined in Options 
7, Section 4 that meet the qualifications. 
For a dividend strategy, a Lead Market 
Maker, Market Maker, Professional, 
Firm and Broker-Dealer that executed 
on the same trading day in the same 
class of options when such members are 
trading: (1) in their own proprietary 
accounts; or (2) on an agency basis, are 
subject to no transaction fee. For a 
merger, short stock interest and box 
spread strategy, a Lead Market Maker, 
Market Maker, Professional, Firm and 
Broker-Dealer that executed on the same 
trading day for all classes of options in 
the aggregate when such members are 
trading (1) in their own proprietary 
accounts; or (2) on an agency basis, are 
subject to no transaction fee. Finally, for 
reversal and conversion and jelly roll 
strategies, a Lead Market Maker, Market 
Maker, Professional, Firm and Broker- 
Dealer that executed on the same 
trading day for all classes of options in 
the aggregate when such members are 
trading (1) in their own proprietary 
accounts; or (2) on an agency basis, are 
subject to no transaction fee. As is the 
case today, Customers are not assessed 
a fee nor receive a rebate for strategy 
transactions. 
The Exchange believes that despite 
the removal of the $0.01 rebate for 
qualifying strategy executions, the 
proposed pricing will continue to attract 
strategy executions to Phlx as it assesses 
no transaction fee for qualifying strategy 
executions 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that its 
proposal is consistent with Section 6(b) 
of the Act,
16
in general, and furthers the 
objectives of Sections 6(b)(4) and 6(b)(5) 
of the Act,
17
in particular, in that it 
provides for the equitable allocation of 
reasonable dues, fees and other charges 
among members and issuers and other 
persons using any facility, and is not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
The Commission and the courts have 
repeatedly expressed their preference 
for competition over regulatory 
intervention in determining prices, 
products, and services in the securities 
markets. In Regulation NMS, while 
adopting a series of steps to improve the 
current market model, the Commission 
highlighted the importance of market 
forces in determining prices and SRO 
revenues and, also, recognized that 
current regulation of the market system 
‘‘has been remarkably successful in 
promoting market competition in its 
broader forms that are most important to 
investors and listed companies.’’
18
 
Likewise, in NetCoalition v. Securities and Exchange Commission
19
 
(‘‘NetCoalition’’) the D.C. Circuit upheld 
the Commission’s use of a market-based 
approach in evaluating the fairness of 
market data fees against a challenge 
claiming that Congress mandated a cost- 
based approach.
20
As the court 
emphasized, the Commission ‘‘intended 
in Regulation NMS that ‘market forces, 
rather than regulatory requirements’ 
play a role in determining the market 
data . . . to be made available to 
investors and at what cost.’’
21
 
Further, ‘‘[n]o one disputes that 
competition for order flow is ‘fierce.’ 
. . . As the SEC explained, ‘[i]n the U.S. 
national market system, buyers and 
sellers of securities, and the broker- 
dealers that act as their order-routing 
agents, have a wide range of choices of 
where to route orders for execution’; 
[and] ‘no exchange can afford to take its 
market share percentages for granted’ 
because ‘no exchange possesses a 
monopoly, regulatory or otherwise, in 
the execution of order flow from broker 
dealers’. . . .’’
22
Although the court and 
the SEC were discussing the cash 
equities markets, the Exchange believes 
that these views apply with equal force 
to the options markets. 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the strategy execution pricing to assess 
no transaction fee on qualifying strategy 
executions is reasonable because despite 
the removal of the $0.01 rebate for 
qualifying strategy executions, the 
proposed pricing will continue to attract 
strategy executions to Phlx. Also, 
Customers will continue to pay no 
strategy execution fees. 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the strategy execution pricing to assess 
no transaction fee on qualifying strategy 
executions is equitable and not unfairly 
discriminatory because the Exchange 
would uniformly assess no transaction 
fee to qualifying strategy executions for 
all members and member organizations. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Act. 
Inter-Market Competition 
The proposal does not impose an 
undue burden on inter-market 
competition. The Exchange believes its 
proposal remains competitive with 
other options markets and will offer 
market participants with another choice 
of where to transact options. The 
Exchange notes that it operates in a 
highly competitive market in which 
market participants can readily favor 
competing venues if they deem fee 
levels at a particular venue to be 
excessive, or rebate opportunities 
available at other venues to be more 
favorable. In such an environment, the 
Exchange must continually adjust its 
fees to remain competitive with other 
exchanges. Because competitors are free 
to modify their own fees in response, 
and because market participants may 
readily adjust their order routing 
practices, the Exchange believes that the 
degree to which fee changes in this 
market may impose any burden on 
competition is extremely limited. 
Intra-Market Competition 
The Exchange’s proposal to amend 
the strategy execution pricing to assess 
no transaction fee on qualifying strategy 
executions does not impose an undue

(‘‘IEX’’ or the ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
(‘‘Commission’’) the proposed rule 
change as described in Items I and II 
below, which Items have been prepared 
by the Exchange. The Commission is 
publishing this notice to solicit 
comments on the proposed rule change 
from interested persons. 
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Terms of Substance of 
the Proposed Rule Change 
Pursuant to the provisions of Section 
19(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (‘‘Act’’),
4
and Rule 19b–4

the Exchange is filing with 
the Commission a proposed rule change 
to amend the certificate of incorporation 
(defined below) of the Exchange’s 
parent company, IEX Group, Inc. 
(‘‘IEXG’’ or ‘‘Group’’) to update certain 
ownership and voting restrictions to 
align them with the equivalent 
provisions in the corporate governance 
documents of other national securities 
exchanges. 
The Exchange has designated this 
proposal as non-controversial and 
provided the Commission with the 
notice required by Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii)

Change 
In its filing with the Commission, the 
self-regulatory organization included 
statements concerning the purpose of

and discussed any comments it received 
on the proposed rule change. The text 
of these statements may be examined at

1. Purpose 
The Exchange proposes to amend 
IEXG’s Third Amended and Restated 
Certificate of Incorporation (the 
‘‘Charter’’)

to reflect amendments that 
were approved by both the Group Board 
and Exchange Board in accordance with 
the terms of the Charter and Delaware 
law. Subject to this rule filing, these 
amendments would update certain of 
the Charter’s provisions regarding 
ownership restrictions and the 
allocation of voting power of Group 
shareholders to better align those 
sections of the Charter with the 
equivalent provisions in the corporate 
governance documents of other national 
securities exchanges. Specifically, as 
described below, these proposed 
amendments to the Charter would apply 
Group’s ownership restrictions to 
owners of all classes of Group stock 
(instead of on a per-class basis as is 
currently done) and would provide for 
the pro rata allocation of voting power

common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share

preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share 
(‘‘Preferred Stock’’). 
10
See Article FOURTH, Section A.1 of the Charter. 
11
See Article FOURTH, Section B. of the Charter. 12
Calculating the voting power of holders of 
Preferred Stock requires determining the number of 
Common Shares into which their Preferred Stock 
shares are convertible. See Article FOURTH, Section B.3.1 of the Charter. Because all Preferred 
Stock is convertible to Common Stock on a one-to- 
one basis, each share of Preferred Stock entitles its 
owner to one vote. See Article FOURTH, Section B.4.1 of the Charter.

entity, government, or political subdivision, agency 
or instrumentality of a government.’’ See Article TENTH, Section A.1 of the Charter.

‘‘Related Persons’’ is broadly defined to include

like IEX, issues preferred and common ‘‘shares’’ to 
its owners. For the purposes of this filing, there is 
no functional difference between units and shares 
of stock. 
25
The 24X Approval Order noted that at the time 
of its approval, the exchange’s CEO, together with 
his Related Persons, owned more than 40% of the 
then-outstanding units of the holding company; the 
Commission granted a temporary exemption to the 
ownership and voting restrictions to allow 24X ‘‘to 
bring its ownership and voting structure in line 
with the ownership and voting restrictions upon 
SEC approval.’’ See 24X Approval Order, supra note 18, at 97097–98.

set forth in the Charter. 
Background 
IEXG is a Delaware corporation 
organized under and by virtue of the 
provisions of the General Corporation 
Law of the State of Delaware (the 
‘‘General Corporation Law’’). 
Amendments to the Charter that must be 
filed with the Commission shall only be 
effective if the amendments are 
submitted to the Exchange’s Board of 
Directors, and if the amendments are 
‘‘filed with or filed with and approved’’ 
by the Commission pursuant to Section 
19 of the Act.
8
As noted in Item 2, 
supra, both the Group and Exchange Boards have approved these proposed 
amendments, which IEX now files with 
the Commission so that IEXG may 
effectuate the proposed changes to the 
Charter. 
IEXG issues two classes of stock: 
‘‘Common Stock’’ and ‘‘Preferred 
Stock.’’
9
Holders of Common Stock are 
entitled to one vote for each share.
10
 
The same is true for holders of each of 
the three series
11
of Preferred Stock.
12
 
The Charter currently limits 
ownership of IEXG stock such that no 
Person,
13
either alone or together with 
its Related Persons,
14
‘‘may own . . . 
shares constituting more than forty 
percent (40%) of any class of capital 
stock of the Corporation.’’
15
The Charter 
imposes a stricter ownership limitation 
for any Exchange Members,
16
who, 
either alone or together with their 
Related Persons, may not own more 
than twenty percent (20%) of any class 
of capital stock in the Corporation.
17
 
Furthermore, the Charter limits the 
amount of voting power that may be 
exercised by any Person, either alone or 
together with its Related Persons.
18
 
Specifically, there is a limitation against 
any Person, either alone or together with 
its Related Persons, voting or causing 
the voting of shares of the capital stock 
of Group that represent more than 
twenty percent (20%) of the voting 
power of the issued and outstanding 
capital stock of Group.
19
Thus, a non- 
Member shareholder may own up to 
40% of any class of the capital stock of 
Group, but that shareholder may only 
vote up to 20% of its shares. 
As described below, IEX believes that 
the proposed changes to the Charter that 
are the subject of this rule filing are 
fully consistent with the Commission’s 
approval of IEX,
20
as well as ownership 
and voting limitations recently 
approved by the Commission for other 
national securities exchanges. 
Proposal 
A. Ownership Restrictions 
In the past year, the Commission 
approved the applications for 
registration as a national securities 
exchange of the 24X National Exchange 
LLC (‘‘24X’’) and the Texas Stock 
Exchange LLC (‘‘TXSE’’).
21
Both the 24X 
and TXSE Approval Orders note that the 
charter for the holding company that 
owns the exchange includes restrictions 
on the ability to own and vote shares of 
stock or ownership units (collectively 
referred to herein as ‘‘shares’’).
22
The 
ownership restrictions contained in the 
24X and TXSE charters are nearly 
identical to the restrictions in the IEXG 
Charter described above, with one 
notable exception: the charters do not 
restrict ownership based upon class of 
shares, but rather impose the ownership 
limitations on an aggregate basis across 
all outstanding shares.
23
 
24X and TXSE both issue multiple 
classes of shares, with some being 
‘‘preferred’’ and others being 
‘‘common.’’
24
Because of how the 24X 
and TXSE Charters are worded, unless 
otherwise approved by the Commission, 
a single person or entity (who is not a 
member of the exchange) could own 
more than 40% of one or more classes 
of shares, so long as it does not own 
more than 40% in the aggregate across 
all then-outstanding shares.
25
 
As noted above, IEXG currently 
restricts ownership of the capital stock 
of IEXG such that no Person, alone or 
together with any Related Persons, may 
own more than 40% ‘‘of any class of 
capital stock of the Corporation.’’

IEX 
now proposes to modify its ownership 
restrictions to match those in the 24X 
and TXSE Charters, such that no Person, 
alone or together with any Related 
Persons, may own more than 40% of the 
Corporation’s capital stock in the 
aggregate, unless otherwise approved by 
the Commission. Under this proposal, a 
Person, alone or together with any 
Related Persons, could own more than 
40% of a class of Group stock, provided 
that the Person does not own more than 
40% of the total outstanding shares of 
all capital stock of the Corporation.
27
 
This change to the Charter would allow 
Group shareholders to have more 
flexibility with respect to the classes of 
stock they may acquire in line with 
ownership restrictions imposed upon 
other national securities exchanges, and 
would provide for Commission prior

See supra note 15. Article TENTH Section 
B.1.3 reads in full: No Person, either alone or 
together with its Related Persons, at any time may, 
directly, indirectly or pursuant to any voting trust, 
agreement, plan or other arrangement, vote or cause 
the voting of shares of the capital stock of the 
Corporation or give any consent or proxy with 
respect to shares representing more than twenty 
percent (20%) of the voting power of the then 
issued and outstanding capital stock of the 
Corporation, nor may any Person, either alone or 
together with its Related Persons, enter into any 
agreement, plan or other arrangement with any 
other Person, either alone or together with its 
Related Persons, under circumstances that would 
result in the shares of capital stock of the 
Corporation that are subject to such agreement, plan 
or other arrangement not being voted on any matter 
or matters or any proxy relating thereto being 
withheld, where the effect of such agreement, plan 
or other arrangement would be to enable any 
Person, either alone or together with its Related 
Persons, to vote, possess the right to vote or cause 
the voting of shares of the capital stock of the 
Corporation which would represent more than 
twenty percent (20%) of said voting power.

approval to the extent IEX seeks in the 
future a waiver of such restrictions. 
Similarly, IEX proposes to modify the 
ownership restrictions for Exchange 
Members to be consistent with the 
proposed ownership restrictions for 
non-Members. As proposed, Exchange 
Members would be able to own more 
than 20% of a class of the capital stock 
of the Corporation while continuing to 
be subject to an ownership restriction 
that they cannot own more than 20% of 
the total outstanding shares of all capital 
stock of the Corporation. 
To effect this change, IEX proposes to 
amend the Charter as follows: 
€Amend Article TENTH, Section B.1.1 to replace the words ‘‘of any class 
of’’ that immediately precede ‘‘capital 
stock’’ with the words ‘‘of the.’’ This 
section will now read in full: ‘‘No 
Person, either alone or together with its 
Related Persons, may own, directly or 
indirectly, of record or beneficially, 
shares constituting more than forty 
percent (40%) of the capital stock of the 
Corporation;’’ 
€Amend Article TENTH, Section B.1.2 to replace the words ‘‘of any class 
of’’ that immediately precede ‘‘capital 
stock’’ with the words ‘‘of the.’’ This 
section will now read in full: ‘‘No 
Exchange Member, either alone or 
together with its Related Persons, may 
own, directly or indirectly, of record or 
beneficially, shares constituting more 
than twenty percent (20%) of the capital 
stock of the Corporation;’’ 
€Amend the first sentence of Article TENTH, Section B.4 to replace the 
words ‘‘of any class of’’ that 
immediately precede ‘‘capital stock’’ 
with the words ‘‘of the.’’ The relevant 
section of the sentence will now read: 
‘‘any Person that either alone or together 
with its Related Persons proposes to 
own, directly or indirectly, of record or 
beneficially, shares of the capital stock 
of the Corporation constituting more 
than forty percent (40%) of the 
outstanding shares of the capital stock 
of the Corporation’’ 
B. Voting Restrictions 
As noted above, although a Person, 
alone or together with its Related 
Persons, may own more than 20% of 
outstanding shares of Group stock, that 
Person may not ‘‘vote or cause the 
voting of shares of the capital stock of 
the Corporation . . . representing more 
than twenty percent (20%) of the voting 
power of the then issued and 
outstanding capital stock of the 
Corporation.’’
28
However, the Charter 
does not specify how excess shares are 
to be treated in calculating voting power 
when the 20% voting limitation applies. 
Accordingly, IEX proposes to add a 
new subsection B.1.3.1 to Article 
TENTH, Section B.1.3 of the Charter 
(which addresses the voting 
limitations). This new subsection will 
introduce a defined term, ‘‘Voting 
Limitation’’, and enumerate what 
happens when one or more 
shareholders’ ownership interest 
exceeds the Voting Limitation. Should 
that occur, the new subsection of the 
Charter specifies that any votes in 
excess of the Voting Limitation shall be 
automatically and proportionally 
redistributed among the remaining 
stockholders entitled to vote on such 
matter. Further, if, as a result of such 
redistribution, any other stockholder 
would exceed the Voting Limitation, the 
same adjustment and redistribution 
procedure shall be applied successively 
until no stockholder exceeds the Voting 
Limitation.
29
Finally, the subsection 
clarifies that the pro rata allocation of 
voting power will be automatic and self- 
executing, although the Group Board 
may adopt any procedures it deems 
advisable to implement this provision of 
the Charter in a fair and equitable 
manner. 
The proposed pro rata allocation of 
voting power described above is 
substantively identical to provisions in 
the BOX Exchange LLC (‘‘BOX’’) 
Charter, which also provides for a pro 
rata voting adjustment (referred to as a 
Voting Units Adjustment) if a BOX 
holder’s economic interest in BOX 
exceeds its voting ownership limit.
30
 
The BOX Charter, like the proposed 
changes to the Group Charter, also 
provides that the Voting Units 
Adjustment would occur in an 
automatic manner.
31
 
2. Statutory Basis 
The Exchange believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b) of the Act,
32
in general, and 
furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(1) 
of the Act in particular,
33
in that it 
continues to assure that the Exchange is 
so organized as to have the capacity to 
be able to carry out the purposes of the 
Act and to comply, and to enforce 
compliance by its Exchange members 
and persons associated with its 
Exchange members, with the provisions 
of the Exchange Act, the rules and 
regulations thereunder, and the rules of 
the Exchange. 
The Exchange also believes that the 
proposed rule change is consistent with 
Section 6(b)(5) of the Act
34
in that it is 
intended to, inter alia, promote just and 
equitable principles of trade, foster 
cooperation and coordination with 
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, 
settling, processing information with 
respect to, and facilitating transactions 
in securities, remove impediments to 
and perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and a national market 
system and, in general, protect investors 
and the public interest. Additionally, 
the proposed amendments are not 
designed to permit unfair 
discrimination between customers, 
issuers, brokers, or dealers. 
As noted in the Purpose section, 
changing the existing ownership 
limitations to apply on an aggregate 
basis across the outstanding shares of 
the Company’s stock, rather than on a 
class-by-class basis, is designed to 
provide more flexibility to IEXG and its 
shareholders as to how they allocate 
ownership of various classes of stock 
while continuing to apply the existing 
ownership limitations, in a manner 
consistent with the Commission’s 
approval of IEX and of other national 
securities exchanges. The Exchange 
believes that the proposed amendments 
thereby fulfill the goals of Section 6(b) 
of the Act
35
in that they are designed to 
promote just and equitable principles of 
trade, remove impediments to and 
perfect the mechanism of a free and 
open market and national market 
system, and in general operate to protect 
investors and the public interest.

41
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6). 
42
In addition, Rule 19b–4(f)(6) requires a self- 
regulatory organization to give the Commission 
written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule 
change at least five business days prior to the date 
of filing of the proposed rule change, or such 
shorter time as designated by the Commission. The 
Exchange has satisfied this requirement. 
43
17 CFR 240.19b–4(f)(6)(iii). 
44
For purposes only of waiving the 30-day 
operative delay, the Commission has also 
considered the proposed rule’s impact on 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation. See 
15 U.S.C. 78c(f). 
45
17 CFR 200.30–3(a)(12). 
Moreover, the proposed amendments to 
the Group Charter are consistent with 
those of other national securities 
exchanges, as discussed in the Purpose 
section.
36
 
Further, as discussed in the Purpose 
section, IEX believes that the proposed 
pro rata allocation of voting interests 
when one or more non-Member 
shareholders own more than 20% of 
Group is consistent with Section 
6(b)(1)
37
of the Act in that this approach 
will continue to assure that the 
Exchange is so organized as to have the 
capacity to be able to carry out the 
purposes of the Act and to comply, and 
to enforce compliance by its Exchange 
members and persons associated with 
its Exchange members, with the 
provisions of the Exchange Act, the 
rules and regulations thereunder, and 
the rules of the Exchange. 
Significantly, the Commission 
recently considered and approved the 
identical type of ownership restrictions 
in the TXSE and 24X exchange 
applications.
38
And the Commission 
considered and approved functionally 
identical reallocation of voting power 
provisions in the BOX Charter.
39
 
In conclusion, based on the foregoing, 
IEX believes that the proposed Charter 
amendments are consistent with the 
investor protection and public interest 
purposes of the Act because they are 
designed to continue to apply 
appropriate ownership and voting 
limitations on Group shareholders, in a 
manner comparable to other national 
securities exchanges, and thus do not 
raise any new or novel issues that have 
not already been considered by the 
Commission. 
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Burden on Competition 
The Exchange does not believe that 
the proposed rule change will impose 
any burden on competition that is not 
necessary or appropriate in furtherance 
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 
The proposed amendments are 
concerned solely with the corporate 
governance of Group, the Exchange’s 
parent corporation, and do not present 
any issues that impact competition. 
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement on Comments on the 
Proposed Rule Change Received From 
Members, Participants, or Others 
Written comments were neither 
solicited nor received. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for 
Commission Action 
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the 
Act
40
and Rule 19b–4(f)(6)
41
 
thereunder, the Exchange has 
designated this proposal as one that 
effects a change that: (i) does not 
significantly affect the protection of 
investors or the public interest; (ii) does 
not impose any significant burden on 
competition; and (iii) by its terms, does 
not become operative for 30 days after 
the date of the filing, or such shorter 
time as the Commission may designate 
if consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest.
42
 
A proposed rule change filed 
pursuant to Rule 19b–4(f)(6) under the 
Act normally does not become operative 
for 30 days after the date of its filing. 
However, Rule 19b–4(f)(6)(iii)
43
permits 
the Commission to designate a shorter 
time if such action is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the public 
interest. The Exchange requested that 
the Commission waive the 30-day 
operative delay. The Exchange asserts 
that this proposal does not raise any 
novel legal or regulatory issues, and it 
states that waiver of the operative delay 
would enable a board meeting with a 
stockholder vote reflecting the revised 
provisions within the next 30 days. As 
such, the Commission believes that it is 
consistent with the protection of 
investors and the public interest for the 
Exchange to implement this proposal 
prior to 30-days from the date of filing. 
Accordingly, the Commission hereby 
waives the 30-day operative delay and 
designates the proposed rule change 
operative upon filing.
44
 
At any time within 60 days of the 
filing of the proposed rule change, the 
Commission summarily may 
temporarily suspend such rule change if 
it appears to the Commission that such 
action is necessary or appropriate in the 
public interest, for the protection of 
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Act. 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing, 
including whether the proposed rule 
change is consistent with the Act.

The Default Management Guidelines, which are 
specific to LCH SA, provide a guide to be used by 
each of LCH SA’s Clearing Services on defining and 
implementing the Service-specific default 
management process in compliance with the 
Default Management Policy. The guidelines 
describe the high-level strategy, principles, 
standards, ownership and governance at LCH SA 
and each Clearing Service. 
9
The head of each Clearing Service is responsible 
for maintaining Default Management Procedures for 
such Service, and such Procedures are reviewed 
quarterly. The Default Management Procedures 
specify the processes and procedures at the Clearing 
Service level for managing a default. These 
procedures must meet the standards laid out in the 
DMP and follow the principles outlined in the 
specific Default Management Guidelines. The 
relevant procedures are set out in Appendix 1 to the 
CDS Clear Rulebook for the CDSClear Service and 
in Chapter 5 of Title IV to the LCH SA Clearing Rule 
Book for LCH SA’s other clearing services. LCH SA 
maintains a Default Management Procedure is in 
place to allow for the appropriate coordination 
across the CCP, including with respect to each 
Service and transversal services, including CaLM. 
10
LCH SA currently maintains 3 separate 
Clearing Services: (i) CDSClear, which provides 
clearing services for credit default swaps; (ii) 
RepoClear SA, which provides clearing services in 
respect of repo and cash transactions on Euro- 
denominated government and supra-national debts 
across thirteen (13) markets (France, Italy, Spain, 
Germany, Belgium, Austria, Finland, Ireland, The 
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and 
Supranational), as well as a basket collateral service 
through its ÖGCPlus triparty basket repo offering; 
(iii) DigitalAssetClear, which provides a fully- 
regulated and segregated clearing service for cash- 
settled Bitcoin index futures and options contracts 
traded on GFO–X, the UK’s first FCA-regulated, 
centrally-cleared multilateral trading facility (MTF) 
dedicated to digital asset futures and options. LCH 
SA formally operated its EquityClear and 
CommodityClear services, each of which has since 
been closed. 
11
Any changes to the Default Management 
Guidelines must be approved by LCH SA’s ERCo 
and shared with the Default Crisis Management 
Team (‘‘DCMT’’). The ERCo, which is chaired by 
LCH SA’s Chief Risk Officer (‘‘CRO’’), is comprised 
of the heads of each Clearing Service, the CROs of 
each Clearing Service, and risk management and 
compliance executives. The DCMT is comprised of 
senior LCH SA executives and is empowered to 
make all relevant decisions during the management 
of a default at LCH SA.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(‘‘Act’’),
1
and Rule 19b–4,
2
notice is 
hereby given that on December 29, 2025, 
Banque Centrale de Compensation, 
which conducts business under the 
name LCH SA (‘‘LCH SA’’), filed with 
the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (‘‘Commission’’) the 
proposed rule change, as described in 
Items I, II and III below, which Items 
have been prepared by the clearing 
agency. The Commission is publishing 
this notice to solicit comments on the 
proposed rule change from interested 
persons. 
I. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Terms of Substance of the Proposed 
Rule Change 
LCH SA is submitting several risk 
policies (‘‘Risk Policies’’) which LCH 
SA has adopted, including: (i) the 
Default Management Policy; (ii) the 
Investment Risk Policy; (iii) the 
Liquidity Risk Policy; (iv) the 
Settlement, Payment and Custody Risk 
Policy; (v) the Model Governance, 
Validation and Review Policy; and (vi) 
the Contract and Market Acceptability 
Policy. The Risk Policies have been 
issued by LCH Group Holdings Limited 
(‘‘LCH Group’’)

and adopted by the 
LCH SA Risk Committee and LCH SA 
Board.

II. Clearing Agency’s Statement of the 
Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the 
Proposed Rule Change 
In its filing with the Commission, 
LCH SA included statements concerning 
the purpose of and basis for the Risk 
Policies and discussed any comments it 
received on the Risk Policies. The text 
of these statements may be examined at 
the places specified in Item IV below. 
LCH SA has prepared summaries, set 
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of 
the most significant aspects of such 
statements. 
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s 
Statement of the Purpose of, and 
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule 
Change 
1. Purpose 
The Risk Policies have been adopted 
by LCH SA in order to set out the 
specific risk management requirements 
that govern its operations as a clearing 
agency. Moreover, the Risk Policies 
clarify the roles and responsibilities 
within LCH SA for compliance with the 
Risk Policies. Finally, the Risk Policies 
have been designed to ensure 
consistency with all relevant laws and 
regulations, including the European 
Markets Infrastructure Regulation 
(‘‘EMIR’’)
5
and Section 17A of the Act
6
 
and the regulations thereunder.
7
 
a. Default Management Policy 
The Default Management Policy 
(‘‘DMP’’) sets out the minimum 
standards that LCH SA must meet in 
managing the default of a clearing 
member. The DMP sits atop a multi- 
tiered default management framework, 
which also includes the Default 
Management Guidelines
8
and the 
Default Management Procedures
9
 
adopted thereunder. 
The Default Management Procedures 
specify the processes and procedures at 
the Clearing Service
10
level for 
managing a default. These procedures 
must meet the standards laid out in the 
DMP and follow the principles outlined 
in the specific Default Management 
Guidelines. The head of each Clearing 
Service (for example, CDSClear which 
provides clearing services for credit 
default swaps) is responsible for 
maintaining Default Management 
Procedures for such Service, and such 
Procedures are reviewed quarterly. The 
relevant procedures are set out in 
Appendix 1 to the CDSClear Rulebook 
for the CDSClear Service and in Chapter 
5 of Title IV to the LCH SA Clearing 
Rule Book for LCH SA’s other clearing 
services. 
The DMP clarifies the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for 
compliance with the DMP. For example, 
LCH SA’s First and Second Line Risk 
teams are responsible for: (i) 
maintaining LCH SA’s Default 
Management Guidelines, which the 
Executive Risk Committee (‘‘ERCo’’) 
must approve;
11
(ii) designing and 
organizing company-wide default 
management fire drill tests on at least an 
annual basis; and (iii) the ongoing 
monitoring of compliance with the 
DMP. 
The DMP also provides that LCH SA’s 
Legal team is responsible, in

The grounds for calling a default must be clear 
and agreed with LCH SA Legal. 
13
In addition, an LCH Group Default Crisis 
Management Team will meet to consider 
coordination across both LCH SA and LCH Limited, 
if necessary. 
14
The brokers/intermediaries must meet the 
requirements set out for this purpose in the LCH SA 
Settlement, Payment and Custody Risk Policy, be 
approved by ERCo at the request of the relevant 
Clearing Service, and should also engage in any fire 
drills. 
15
LCH SA’s CEO (or the CEO’s authorized 
delegate) has the authority to make final decisions, 
but can delegate authority to each DMG to develop 
and execute the liquidation strategy and hedging 
and porting solutions, which must be approved by 
LCH SA’s CRO (or the CRO’s authorized delegate). 
Explicit approval of LCH SA’s CEO and CRO must 
be obtained before the DMG executes any actions 
that would require the use of LCH SA’s skin in the 
game (SITG). 
16
The default management procedures may not 
contradict the Rulebook. 
17
Each Clearing Service must notify LCH SA Risk 
of the planning and scope of each Clearing Service’s 
fire drill testing (e.g., actions, products, portfolio, included in the fire drill testing). 
18
Collateral pricing is subject to the standards set 
out in the Contract and Market Acceptability Policy, 
discussed below. 
conjunction with each Clearing Service, 
the Rule Change Committee and LCH 
SA Compliance, for ensuring that key 
aspects of default procedures are 
publicly disclosed in the Rulebook or 
other disclosures; and, in conjunction 
with LCH SA’s External 
Communications, for drafting the 
default notice in case of default. LCH 
SA’s Compliance team is responsible for 
notifying the relevant regulators in the 
event of a default. LCH SA Finance is 
responsible for producing the financial 
statement at the end of the default 
management process. 
The DMP also sets out applicable 
default governance standards. In 
particular, the DMP establishes that it is 
the responsibility of LCH SA’s Chief 
Executive Officer (‘‘CEO’’), or the CEO’s 
authorized delegate, acting on the 
recommendation of the CRO, or the 
CRO’s authorized delegate, to place a 
clearing member in default
12
and 
initiate a DCMT.
13
In addition, the DMP 
confirms that regulators and relevant 
exchanges should be notified as soon as 
the decision is taken to place a member 
in default, and a default notice should 
be delivered more generally according 
to the Rulebook. Further, a market 
communication strategy should be 
executed. 
The head of the affected Clearing 
Service will convene its Default 
Management Group (‘‘DMG’’) to manage 
the default, under the supervision and 
oversight of the DCMT. The standards 
that a DMG must meet are also 
described, in particular that the DMG 
must be accessible at short notice and 
emergency contact details must be 
maintained for such purpose. For 
example, if the DMG includes clearing 
member traders, the DMG should enter 
into contractual agreements with such 
traders that ensure their independence 
and outline their duty to provide 
impartial advice to LCH SA. Further, if 
the DMG relies on brokers/ 
intermediaries to perform the 
liquidation strategy (i.e., no other exit options are available), a minimum of 
two contractually-regulated 
relationships should be in place.
14
 
Moreover, a secretary must be 
appointed, and the DMG will be 
responsible for documenting critical 
actions and decisions and maintain 
records of all relevant documents and 
emails. 
The DMP requires the Default 
Management Procedures of each 
Clearing Service to have a defined exit 
methodology for a defaulted clearing 
member’s portfolio.
15
In addition, the 
procedures must describe: (i) the 
hedging and execution methodology for 
neutralizing material directional risks of 
the defaulting portfolio, where 
applicable; (ii) the intended auction 
process, where an auction is relied 
upon; (iii) the portability arrangements 
necessary to facilitate the porting and 
liquidation of a clearing member’s 
clients’ positions and collateral; (iv) the 
default management reporting 
capability, distinguishing segregated 
assets and liabilities for each member 
and client account at both intra-day and 
end of day intervals; (v) the operational 
control framework, which should at 
least ensure all risk positions are 
adequately reconciled and accounted for 
prior to engaging the exit strategy; and 
(vi) the communications strategy to 
internal and external stakeholders.
16
 
The DMP further requires each 
Clearing Service to maintain sufficient 
resources to support the default 
management process. Although 
resources may be drawn from the 
support and operations departments, 
staff made available for default 
management process cannot jeopardize 
the resources required for on-going 
‘‘business as usual’’ functions. In 
addition, the DMG must be familiar 
with each Clearing Service’s Business 
Continuity Plan in place and the back- 
up arrangements for performing their 
tasks in all circumstances (including 
extreme but plausible scenarios such as 
the unavailability of the office site and/ 
or external DMG members). 
The DMP requires each Clearing 
Service, in coordination with its DMG, 
to conduct regular fire drill tests 
including testing extreme but plausible 
scenarios and to participate in the 
annual joint fire drill exercises across 
both CCPs.
17
The procedures that LCH 
SA must follow if it requests a 
temporary exception to any of the 
policies set out in the DMP are also 
described. Finally, the DMP confirms 
that LCH SA’s CEO and CRO (or their 
respective authorized delegates if either 
or both are unavailable) may jointly 
determine to override the DMP if the 
application leads to results which are 
not in line with the intent of the policy 
(e.g., by delaying action or increasing risk). In these circumstances, the DMP 
provides that the LCH SA Board must be 
notified of such actions as soon as 
practicable. 
b. Investment Risk Policy 
The Investment Risk Policy (‘‘IRP’’) 
sets out the LCH Group standards for 
the management of investment risk at 
LCH SA. The key principles of these 
standards are capital preservation and 
liquidity management. The IRP applies 
to the investment of cash funds derived 
from: (i) margins; (ii) default fund 
contributions; (iii) CCP capital and 
retained earnings; and (iv) settlement 
failures. 
The IRP clarifies the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH Group and 
LCH SA for compliance with the IRP. 
The policy owner is the LCH SA CRO. 
In addition: 
€LCH SA Credit Risk is responsible for assigning and maintaining (i) 
counterparty Internal Credit Scores 
(‘‘ICS’’) according to the Counterparty 
Credit Risk Policy, and (ii) counterparty 
limits within the framework outlined in 
the IRP; 
€LCH SA’s Collateral and Liquidity Management (‘‘CaLM’’) team is 
responsible for (i) investment and 
monitoring activities in accordance with 
the IRP and other relevant Group Risk 
policies and all relevant regulations, (ii) 
for static data and collateral pricing,
18
 
and (iii) annually reviewing the 
appropriateness of controls that are 
managed by Triparty agents in 
accordance with this policy, where 
possible; 
€LCH SA’s Risk Collateral and Liquidity Risk Management (‘‘CaLM 
Risk’’) team is responsible for 
independently assessing and monitoring 
investment exposures, including 
country and supranational 
concentration risk; 
€LCH SA Compliance is responsible for monitoring that a suitable framework 
is in place to maintain compliance with 
all relevant regulations regarding CaLM 
activities, and for monitoring relevant 
regulatory rules and circulating relevant

khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES317 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 19
Certain non-guaranteed entities are permitted 
issuers in limited circumstances where, despite the 
lack of a formal guarantee, the entity receives 
capital support from an eligible government and is 
determined to be systemically important by 
fulfilling a public policy mission, and no legislation 
is planned to remove either the capital support or 
change the public policy mission. 
20
Derivatives may be executed only with eligible 
credit and financial institutions and are only 
permitted to: (i) hedge the portfolio of a defaulted 
clearing member as part of LCH SA’s Default 
Management Procedure; or (ii) hedge currency risk 
arising from LCH SA’s liquidity management 
framework. 
21
In normal market conditions, FX products are 
used only for the purpose of testing liquidity 
arrangements, reducing exposures in non-reporting 
currencies, or, subject to approval of the LCH SA 
CRO (or authorized delegate), meeting operational 
liquidity shortfalls. When managing a default, FX 
products may be used to eliminate the risk 
associated with collateral liquidations or product 
flows as well as the variation margin to be paid by 
LCH SA to non-defaulters in a currency other than 
the currency in which such margin has been 
deposited. 
22
For example, such repurchase and reverse 
repurchase transactions must only be executed with 
Central Banks, Credit/Financial Institutions and 
should be conducted in accordance with the 
applicable legal agreements. In addition, specific 
counterparty limits, issuer limits and concentration 
limits are set out in an annex to the IRP. 
23
Applicable counterparty limits, instrument 
limits and concentration limits are set out in an 
annex to the IRP. 
24
LCH SA Operations also support operations 
associated with liquidity/credit arrangements at 
Central Banks and Central Securities Depositories. 
25
LCH SA holds all cash assets at either Central 
Banks or at highly creditworthy commercial banks 
as prescribed in the Settlement, Payment and 
Custody Risk Policy. The remaining liquidity 
resources described below constitute assets that are 
readily available and convertible into cash through 
prearranged funding arrangements such as 
repurchase agreements and Central Bank 
arrangements. LCH SA also permits other 
prearranged funding arrangements that are 
determined by the Board to be highly reliable even 
in extreme but plausible market conditions. 
26
Separately, the LRP explains that, in 
circumstances in which LCH SA is authorized to 
deposit clearing member cash with a Central Bank 
and the Central Bank requires LCH SA to set a target 
daily operating balance, CaLM is responsible for 
setting the target operating balance, with the 
approval of the CRO and the ERCo. 
27
Other potential draws on liquidity include an 
increase of cash or collateral that is encumbered for 
credit lines at international central securities 
depositories (‘‘ICSDs’’) and settlement agents. 
requirements to the appropriate internal 
stakeholders; and 
€LCH SA Legal is responsible for preparation of the necessary legal 
documents, and where relevant, provide 
a review on segregation arrangements. 
The IRP restricts counterparty and 
eligible issuers to sovereign 
governments, central banks, institutions 
guaranteed by one or more governments 
of approved sovereigns with an ICS of 
three (3) or above and where no 
legislation is planned to remove the 
guarantee,
19
certain supranational 
entities, and credit and financial 
institutions, each of which must meet 
the internal credit scores or other 
standards set out in the IRP. The IRP 
also establishes investment criteria with 
regard to cash, securities, derivatives,
20
 
foreign exchange (‘‘FX’’) products
21
and 
repurchase and reverse repurchase 
transactions.
22
 
In addition, the IRP sets out 
requirements with regard to the 
approval of new investment products. 
All new investment products must be 
reviewed and approved by the ERCo 
and must go through the New Product 
Approval process. Further, if a new 
investment product introduces new and 
novel risks to LCH SA, the IRP provides 
that the investment product must also 
be reviewed by the Risk Committee and 
approved by the Board. 
The IRP also sets investment risk 
limits, i.e., weighted average maturity, secured versus unsecured and 
counterparty concentration, clarifies the 
responsibility for approving a new 
investment counterparty or issuer and 
clarifies the process by which 
counterparties, issuers and 
concentration limits are approved and 
modified including any applicable 
haircuts. 
The IRP sets out the counterparty, 
issuer and limit approval change 
process to provide that the ERCo must 
approve any new counterparty or issuer. 
The ERCo will also assign a 
counterparty limit within the framework 
outlined by the IRP. Any limit changes 
must be within the framework outlined 
in the IRP annexes and notified to CaLM 
and CaLM Risk.
23
 
The IRP also provides that CaLM Risk 
is responsible for monitoring country 
and supranational concentration. The 
IRP provides that unsecured deposits 
may be held in the Banque de France 
without monitoring, but deposits in all 
other central banks are subject to (and 
counted towards) country concentration 
monitoring thresholds, unless otherwise 
approved by the ERCo. 
c. Liquidity Risk Policy 
The Liquidity Risk Policy (‘‘LRP’’) 
sets out the LCH Group standards for 
the management of liquidity risk at LCH 
SA. The basic goal of the LRP is to 
ensure that LCH SA has enough cash on 
hand to meet all the expected and 
unexpected financial obligations that 
arise during the course of the day. The 
LRP describes how LCH SA will 
measure whether it has enough 
available cash, both daily and intraday. 
The LRP sets out the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for 
compliance with the LRP. In this regard, 
the LRP clarifies that: (i) LCH SA CaLM 
is responsible for maintaining a 
liquidity plan, conducting liquidity tests 
and managing the day-to-day liquidity 
of LCH SA according to the standards 
set out in the LRP, and for notifying the 
ERCo immediately of any exceptions; 
(ii) LCH SA CaLM Risk monitors and 
measures the adequacy of the cash 
levels held to meet the outflows, and 
reports issues for potential corrective 
action to CaLM; and (iii) LCH SA 
Operations is responsible for the 
operational and control processes 
related to intraday liquidity flows and 
interoperability arrangements.
24
Any 
exceptions to the established policies 
will require a formal request to ERCo, a 
notification to the LCH SA Risk 
Committee, and approval from the 
Board and LCH SA Risk Committee. 
The LRP also identifies the different 
sources and availability of liquidity,
25
 
including: (i) cash from deposits and 
maturing investments; (ii) LCH SA 
proprietary unencumbered (non-cash) 
assets managed by CaLM; and (iii) 
unencumbered assets from repurchase 
transactions undertaken by CaLM 
(including defaulted clearing members). 
In addition, LCH SA may also use 
available Central Bank arrangements to 
generate same-day liquidity by pledging 
non-cash collateral deposited by its 
members on a title transfer basis. LCH 
SA can also access a defaulted clearing 
member’s non-cash margin collateral. In 
addition, LCH SA may access any 
RepoClear assets ‘‘received versus 
payment’’ from non-defaulting 
RepoClear counterparties in respect of 
transactions with a defaulted RepoClear 
clearing member.
26
 
The LRP clarifies that LCH SA’s two 
main sources of liquidity needs are: (i) 
operational liquidity, e.g., repayment of excess cash collateral to clearing 
members, substitution of cash collateral 
upon clearing member request, 
provision of liquidity to facilitate 
settlement including fails, overall 
reduction in Liabilities (Initial and 
Additional Margin) and thus cash 
posted for margin coverage, and FX 
Options warehouse cash replenishment; 
and (ii) default liquidity, e.g., fulfilment of the settlement obligations of a 
defaulted clearing member, posting of 
variation margins to non-defaulting 
members on the positions held by a 
defaulted clearing member, and hedging 
costs and potential losses due to the 
liquidation of the cleared positions and 
collateral posted by a defaulted clearing 
member.
27
 
The LRP also describes the steps that 
LCH SA takes to assess its liquidity 
position. In particular, the LRP notes 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00090 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES318 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 28
LCH SA’s material currency is the Euro, as 
specified in the Model Governance, Validation and 
Review Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, the LRP 
requires that exposures to all non-material 
currencies (i.e., other than Euro, including GBP and USD) be monitored on a daily basis as well. 
29
With the ERCo approval, LCH SA may use a 
shorter period of 5 days. 
30
Annex I, Intraday Liquidity Monitoring, to the 
LRP provides additional detail on the factors that 
LCH SA should take into account in assessing 
intraday liquidity. 
31
In addition, LCH SA also models the gross 
liquidity impact of the default of the family 
participant with the largest liquidity requirement 
for a specific SEC compliant liquidity metric. 
32
The LRP explains that an event is deemed to 
be implausible if it is considered to have a 
likelihood of occurrence of less than once in 30 
years. If an event is not deemed to be implausible, 
it is considered plausible. 
33
The LRP further clarifies in Appendix II that 
LCH SA will review the models used to conduct 
liquidity stress testing more frequently than 
monthly, as required by Exchange Act rule 17ad– 
22(e)(7)(vi), when the products cleared or markets 
served display high volatility or become less liquid, 
when the size or concentration of positions held by 
the clearing agency’s participants increases 
significantly, or in other appropriate circumstances 
described in dedicated procedures. 
34
The results of the reverse stress tests are used 
to evaluate the adequacy of LCH SA’s liquidity risk 
management framework and, if needed, to make the 
necessary adjustments to that framework. In 
addition, the LRP provides that the findings are 
evaluated to ensure that the testing scenarios are 
appropriate to determine LCH SA’s liquidity needs 
and resources considering current and evolving 
market conditions. 
35
The liquidity assessment is subject to certain 
limits and restrictions specified in the LRP. 
Specifically, the liquidity coverage ratio for LCH 
(defined as the total available liquid assets at the 
start of the business day divided by the total 
liquidity requirements for that day) must be at least 
105% on each day during the assessment period, 
and no one member within a given Clearing Service 
may use more than 25% of available liquidity 
following the default of the member that is the 
largest liquidity user assuming that the repo market 
is fully closed (‘‘25% Member Cash Limit’’). 
36
The concentration limits applicable to LCH 
SA’s protected payment system (‘‘PPS’’) banks and 
concentration banks is governed by the Settlement, 
Payment, and Custody Risk Policy. 
37
The establishment of such credit lines requires 
Board approval. The credit provider must be 
approved by the ERCo and maintain a minimum 
ICS. A member’s line of credit with LCH SA does 
not count towards the available liquidity resources 
in the event of that member’s default. 
38
LCH SA is required under the EMIR framework 
to deposit margin, default fund contributions and 
other financial resources with the operator of the 
ICSD in a manner that ensures the full protection 
of those assets. The LRP also clarifies that ICSD 
credit lines, which are used to facilitate settlement 
of LCH SA’s clearing and investment activities, are 
generally not counted as liquidity assets, provided 
that such lines are not committed and not 
associated with Central Bank arrangements. Assets 
pledged against ICSD credit lines are deducted from 
LCH SA’s available liquidity resources to reflect 
their encumbrance. 
39
Appendix II also establishes the monthly 
reverse stress testing arrangements. 
40
Intermediaries covered by the CRP include: (i) 
central banks; (ii) settlement platforms; (iii) 
international or domestic central securities 
depositories (ICSDs and CSDs); (iv) settlement 
agents; (v) custodians and sub-custodians; (vi) 
concentration banks; (vii) protected payment 
system (PPS) banks; and (viii) other intermediaries 
which give rise to settlement, payment or custody 
risks. 
41
See Exchange Act Release No. 34–104051 
(September 25, 2025), File No. SR–LCH SA–2025– 
007, which approved the LCH SA Risk Governance 
Framework (RGF) defining the term ‘‘very low’’ as: 
‘‘LCH is not willing to accept risks in most 
circumstances. The Board should decide if the 
benefits outweigh the costs and the risk is worth 
taking.’’ 
42
See Exchange Act Release No. 34–104051 
(September 25, 2025), File No. SR–LCH SA–2025– 
007, which approved the LCH SA Counterparty 
Credit Risk Policy. 
that the assessment must be run: (i) 
daily at an aggregated level and on all 
material currencies;
28
(ii) over a 
forward liquidity period of 30 days;
29
 
and intraday at various times when the 
CCP has scheduled obligations to pay.
30
 
In addition, the assessment must factor 
in regulatory restrictions on the use and 
liquidation of client assets maintained 
in segregated accounts and consider 
stress scenarios that include restricted 
market access and behavioral 
assumptions on how members may 
withdraw cash during times of stress. 
Importantly, the LRP provides that the 
liquidity assessment must: (i) model the 
gross liquidity impact of the default of 
the two member groups with the largest 
liquidity requirement;
31
(ii) include 
‘‘extreme but plausible’’ stress 
scenarios;
32
and (iii) include reverse 
stress testing that models extreme but 
plausible market scenarios in order to 
help determine the limits of the current 
model, including the plausibility 
thresholds which would trigger more in- 
depth analysis.
33
The model used to 
conduct liquidity stress testing must be 
reviewed through reverse stress testing 
on at least a monthly basis, with any 
findings reported to the CRO, the ERCo 
and the Risk Committee, and validated 
annually by an independent Model 
Validation Team, with any findings 
reported to ERCo and the Risk 
Committee.
34
Finally, CaLM is 
responsible for evaluating the reliability 
of LCH SA’s liquidity arrangements by 
assessing the availability of the liquidity 
resources through due diligence and/or 
testing processes.
35
 
The LRP provides that LCH CaLM 
Risk is responsible for maintaining a 
liquidity tiering scale reflecting the 
liquidity risk of the collateral posted by 
clearing members. It also identifies the 
extreme but plausible stress scenarios 
that LCH SA must run as part of its 
liquidity stress tests. 
The LRP also establishes a framework 
for monitoring concentration risks in 
LCH SA’s liquidity resources.
36
For each 
Clearing Service, cash margin posted by 
members must remain within the 25% 
Member Cash Limit, and LCH SA 
therefore requires advance notice for 
replacing cash with non-cash margin 
and may limit returns of cash margin to 
ensure such limits are not breached. In 
addition, no member can provide more 
than 25% of LCH SA’s committed credit 
lines.
37
There are no concentration 
limits in relation to credit lines with 
international central securities 
depositories (ICSDs).
38
 
Finally, Appendix II sets out two 
additional liquidity stress testing and 
reporting requirements.
39
First, the 
Board will be presented, not less than 
annually, with an analysis of the 
prearranged non-committed funding 
arrangements that are included as part 
of LCH SA’s available liquidity 
resources for purposes of its liquidity 
assessments, in order to determine 
whether such resources are highly 
reliable even in extreme but plausible 
market conditions. In addition, 
Appendix II to the LRP specifies that the 
scenarios in which such reverse stress 
testing reviews will be undertaken more 
frequently than monthly are where the 
products cleared or markets served 
display high volatility or become less 
liquid, when the size or concentration of 
members’ positions increases 
significantly, or in other appropriate 
circumstances described in dedicated 
procedures. 
d. Settlement, Payment and Custody 
Risk Policy 
The Settlement, Payment and Custody 
Risk Policy (‘‘CRP’’) sets out the LCH 
Group standards for the management of 
risks to LCH SA that arise from the 
intermediaries used for settlement, 
payment and custody activities.
40
The 
purpose of the CRP is to mitigate the 
risks arising from the default or 
operational failure of one or more 
intermediaries, including: (i) the credit 
risk from direct unsecured exposure; (ii) 
the increase in clearing member 
exposures from failed or delayed margin 
payments; and (iii) liquidity risk from 
delayed access to securities held as 
collateral or investments. It provides 
that the LCH SA Board’s risk appetite 
for settlement, payment and custodian 
risk is very low.
41
 
The CRP also establishes the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for 
compliance with the CRP. In this regard: 
€LCH SA CaLM Risk is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of 
compliance with the requirements of 
this policy, and LCH SA Credit Risk is 
responsible for assigning and 
maintaining the intermediaries’ internal 
credit scores (ICS) in accordance with 
the Counterparty Credit Risk Policy;
42
 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00091 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES319 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 43
Such activities include: (i) maintaining at all 
times a current list of intermediary accounts; (ii) 
ownership of back-up intermediary procedures; (iii) 
determining back-up intermediary arrangements for 
collateral and investment related activities; (iv) 
facilitating contingency payment arrangements for 
clearing members in the absence or failure of PPS 
banks; and (v) conducting annual contingency 
testing. 
44
In this case, the CRP notes that a suitable 
transition period should be provided to minimize 
impacts to financial system stability. 
€LCH SA Operations is responsible for: (i) overseeing the on-boarding 
process including requesting from LCH 
SA Credit Risk an ICS prior to opening 
accounts and obtaining relevant internal 
governance approvals, including 
compliance and legal where applicable; 
(ii) undertaking the required due 
diligence to establish and maintain an 
intermediary relationship, including 
execution of necessary legal agreements; 
(iii) regularly updating LCH SA CaLM 
and LCH SA CaLM Risk with a list of 
all liquidity facilities associated with 
settlement and payment activities; (iv) 
monitoring of payment and settlement 
activities and timely escalation of fails; 
(v) facilitating settlements in accordance 
with the policy; (vi) reconciliations and 
delivery of end of day intermediary 
position reports; and (vii) ensuring that 
relevant infrastructure and back up 
arrangements are adequate to perform 
settlement and payment activities as 
required by LCH SA;
43
 
€LCH SA CaLM is responsible for: (i) the organization and establishment of 
investment-related liquidity facilities, 
including execution of necessary legal 
agreements; (ii) sponsoring any new or 
existing investment-related 
intermediary within the LCH SA 
governance framework; and (iii) funding 
settlement activities of the clearing 
services; 
€LCH SA Clearing Services is responsible for: (i) determination and 
application of the related intraday and 
overnight liquidity facilities required to 
reliably conduct clearing services; (ii) 
maintaining a list of all facilities 
associated with clearing activities, 
including liquidity facilities, which is 
available on demand with any changes 
notified to LCH SA CaLM and LCH SA 
CaLM Risk; (iii) sponsoring any new or 
existing clearing-related intermediary 
within the LCH Group governance 
framework; and (iv) ensuring that the 
relevant clearing infrastructure and 
back-up intermediary arrangements are 
adequate to perform clearing activities 
as required by LCH SA; and 
€LCH SA Legal is responsible for ensuring that all legal documents are 
consistent with regulatory requirements 
and signed by an authorized signatory. 
The CRP provides that all 
intermediaries must meet the internal 
credit score assigned by LCH SA Credit 
Risk and confirms that, in selecting an 
intermediary, central banks are 
preferred over any other intermediary 
and ICSD/CSD are preferred over credit 
institutions. The steps that should be 
taken if an intermediary no longer meets 
the established criteria in order to 
mitigate the risk to LCH SA are also 
described. In this regard, in the event 
that an existing intermediary is 
downgraded such that it no longer 
meets the entry criteria, the CRP 
provides that LCH SA ERCo must be 
notified. Further, a risk mitigation plan 
should be put in place and approved by 
LCH SA ERCo, which may include, but 
is not limited to: (i) the intermediary not 
being able to offer the service to any 
additional clearing members; (ii) the 
intermediary being subject to more 
frequent operational due diligence, 
including responding to LCH SA’s 
request for additional information to 
assess its capability to perform its 
contractual services; and (iii) 
termination of the intermediary’s 
status.
44
 
The CRP provides that the due 
diligence that LCH SA conducts with 
regard to intermediaries must allow 
LCH to meet its regulatory obligations in 
respect of segregation of assets. In this 
regard, the CRP states that the due 
diligence on operational framework/ 
performance and segregation must be set 
up to be refreshed at least once every 
two years (or sooner if there are 
significant changes) by LCH SA 
Operations and results posted and any 
escalations or issues reported to LCH SA 
ERCo. In addition, where an 
intermediary used by LCH SA in the 
securities settlement or custody 
processes with a Clearing Member 
belongs to the same group as the 
Member itself, the CRP provides that 
LCH SA is permitted to hold at the 
intermediary only passive balances 
described in the Appendix. Moreover, 
the due diligence process must confirm 
that assets held in custody by such an 
intermediary will remain segregated in 
the event of the insolvency of the 
intermediary or an intermediate affiliate 
company, and as such be released 
promptly. 
The CRP details other business 
requirements, including relating to PPS 
and concentration banks, which should 
offer finality of payment. Any deviation 
from the CRP including, but not limited 
to, any reduction in market standards in 
terms of finality of payment, should 
result in the LCH Clearing Member 
having alternative settlement risk 
mitigation in place. The CRP also 
requires that either a backup 
intermediary or contingency plans must 
be in place. To that end, LCH SA is 
required to have at least two formalized 
and regularly tested arrangements for 
each of the following services: (a) 
security settlement platform/system, 
and (b) commercial concentration bank. 
Where there is no back-up intermediary 
in the market or where none can be 
established using reasonable 
commercial efforts, contingency plans 
which address the non-availability of a 
back-up must be maintained. 
In addition, the CRP specifies the 
controls that must be in place to 
validate all payment amounts and 
recipients and requires that such 
controls must be independently tested 
at least annually. Reconciliation 
controls also must be in place for cash 
and securities with custodian, 
settlement and payment banks. 
The CRP describes the procedures by 
which LCH SA monitors the risks to 
which LCH SA and its clearing members 
may be exposed, including the 
Appendix to the policy, which sets the 
exposure limits for LCH SA with regard 
to: (i) overnight direct credit exposure of 
LCH SA to the intermediaries resulting 
from settlement, payment and custody 
activities; and (ii) intraday unsecured 
exposure to commercial concentration 
banks as a result of concentration and 
investment activities. In particular, the 
CRP provides that intraday limit usage 
is monitored by LCH SA Collateral 
Operations team and any breaches must 
be reported to LCH SA Credit Risk, LCH 
SA CaLM and LCH SA CaLM Risk staff 
immediately. The report should contain 
details regarding usage, breaches, 
explanation and remediation. 
e. Model Governance, Validation and 
Review Policy 
The Model Governance, Validation 
and Review Policy (‘‘MGVRP’’) sets out 
the relevant steps relating to (i) a new 
or changed model from initiation to 
validation and (ii) regular independent 
model validation and backtesting of all 
models. The policy provides a 
consistent framework across LCH Group 
to ensure that all models meet the 
relevant quality criteria and that a 
validation process meeting all 
regulatory requirements is followed. 
The MGVRP applies to a new, change 
or review of: (i) a margin model that 
estimates market risk under certain 
conditions or assumptions; (ii) a stress 
testing framework used for default fund 
sizing; (iii) a model providing a 
valuation for a financial product subject 
to a CCP guarantee or received as 
collateral; (iv) a credit scoring model 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00092 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES320 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 45
The MGVRP notes that there are circumstances 
in which clearing members are required to 
contribute further resources over and above the 
amounts derived from margin models and margin 
model add-ons. Where these are determined from 
existing financial risk limits such as the CCP Cover 
2 Limit, the CCP Concentration Limit, or any other 
such limit or threshold described in the credit and 
financial risk policies, such limits are outside the 
scope of the MGVRP. 
46
LCH SA’s Head of Market Risk/Credit Risk can 
delegate to the LCH Group Model Working Group 
(‘‘MWG’’) tasks relating to the monitoring and 
oversight of model development and change 
process. 
47
The independent party must have the relevant 
knowledge and experience to perform this task and 
will not be involved in any way in the model 
building and testing process. 
48
Reference to relevant regulatory provisions, 
including EMIR/ESMA technical standards and 
CFTC rules are provided, as well as a broad 
statement requiring compliance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
49
To the extent practicable, LCH will apply the 
same standards and rules to models supplied by 
third parties as are applied to models developed in- 
house. 
50
Non-material changes in high importance 
models and low importance models require review 
by FRWG followed by approval by ERCo, in the 
case of high importance models, and notification to 
ERCo, in the case of low importance models. 
providing an assessment of the 
creditworthiness of a CCP’s 
counterparties; (v) a liquidity risk 
framework managing the risk that LCH 
Group and its entities do not have 
sufficient liquidity to meet their 
payment obligations as they fall due 
under certain market conditions; (vi) a 
collateral risk framework defining the 
haircut methodology applicable to 
eligible collateral posted by members; 
and (vii) a model performance 
framework inclusive of statistical back- 
testing. These features include: (i) 
reliance on underlying (historical) data, 
i.e., the model uses relevant (historical) data; (ii) assumptions, i.e., relevant assumptions on distribution and model 
volatility; (iii) parameters, i.e., inputs into the model (could be equal to (i) in 
some models) which are relevant for the 
evaluation of an event, price or credit 
score; (iv) methodology/algorithm, i.e., a processing component that transforms 
the historical model inputs into the 
estimates; and (v) separate outcome, i.e., 
the estimated risk, price or credit score 
using the methodology and relevant 
inputs.
45
 
The MGVRP also clarifies and 
expands upon the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for 
compliance with the MGVRP. The 
policy explains that: (i) the relevant 
model owners are responsible for the 
initiation, development, 
implementation, documentation and 
maintenance of their models (and the 
relating model risk); and (ii) LCH SA 
Risk is responsible for the identification, 
review and assessment of margin 
methodologies, margin parameter 
review and approval, model 
performance review, evaluation of 
model changes and review of pricing 
and valuation methods.
46
Further, the 
LCH SA Model Validation team or an 
external party will be responsible for 
independently validating each model 
yearly at least once every 12 months to 
confirm that the model is still 
performing adequately.
47
 
The MGVRP reaffirms that all models 
within the scope of the policy must 
meet the at regulatory requirements in 
each jurisdiction applicable to the 
model.
48
In addition, model risk should 
remain within the LCH Board risk 
appetite as described in the LCH Risk 
Governance Framework. Moreover, 
model performance, allowable offsets 
and required counter cyclical features 
should meet the requirements described 
in the LCH Financial Resource 
Adequacy Policy and LCH 
Procyclicality Policy. 
The MGVRP provides, in addition, 
that LCH will document all models in 
a model inventory, to record key 
attributes and allow for the tracking of 
model validation actions and classify 
the importance of each model as either 
high importance or low importance 
based on the potential financial impact 
in the event the model is incorrect. A 
model is of high importance if, in the 
event it is incorrect, it could lead to a 
shortfall in (i) LCH SA capital greater 
than 10 percent, (ii) prefunded financial 
resources (in the waterfall) greater than 
five (5) percent, or (iii) total margin 
requirements for a class of financial 
instruments greater than 10 percent. A 
model is of low importance if, in the 
event it is incorrect, it will not lead to 
a shortfall greater than any of the above. 
An assessment of the importance of a 
model will be performed by the LCH 
SA’s Head of Market Risk/Credit Risk, 
the LCH SA CRO, and/or the Deputy 
CRO. 
The model governance process 
depends on the importance of the model 
and actions taken for any model.
49
New 
models and material changes in models 
with high importance require full risk 
governance review, including: (i) 
member consultation and review as 
required by local supervisors; (ii) peer 
review by quantitative experts through 
the MWG; (iii) review by Financial Risk 
Working Group (‘‘FRWG’’); (iv) 
independent validation of the model; (v) 
approval by ERCo; (vi) review by the 
Risk Committee; (vii) approval by the 
relevant Board; and (viii) review and/or 
approval by regulators, if applicable. 
New models and material changes in 
models with low importance, on the 
other hand require review by FRWG and 
approval by ERCo.
50
 
A revision to a model is considered a 
material change if it meets one of the 
following criteria: 
€The model revision leads to substantial change in outcomes, 
especially where it leads to a reduction 
of coverage. The following changes in 
outcomes after model revision are 
considered material: (i) CCP capital 
changes more than +/¥10 percent; (ii) 
prefunded financial resources (in the 
waterfall) change more than +/¥ five (5) percent; (iii) total margin requirements 
for a class of financial instruments 
change more than +/¥10 percent; (iv) a 
decrease or increase of the estimated 
liquidity needs in any major currency 
(for LCH SA, EUR) greater than 20% or 
the total liquidity needs greater than 
10% (based on end of day positions); or 
(v) a decrease or increase of the total 
value of non-cash collateral at a CCP 
level greater than 10%; 
€A change is made to a key parameter of the model which in the 
future may result in a substantial change 
in outcomes; 
€The model revision leads to a change in theoretical and empirical 
underpinnings of the model; or 
€The model revision also leads to a change in risk policy. 
The MGVRP describes the manner in 
which LCH SA will conduct daily 
backtesting of portfolios and margin 
models to verify the performance of all 
employed margin models. LCH SA 
performs the following types of 
backtesting: 
€Portfolio backtesting to assure the appropriate overall functioning of the 
model and to test if the required 
confidence interval was met; and 
€Additional backtesting to verify the underlying reasons/causes of breaches 
on portfolio level or to identify 
underlying weakness of the model 
relating to certain products, risk types or 
market conditions. 
A summary of backtesting exceptions 
(i.e., P&L changes in excess of margin coverage) is reported daily. If the 
headline frequency and materiality of 
backtesting breaches indicate that the 
required confidence interval cannot be 
met or exceptions are verified alongside 
stress testing results, further 
investigation on the validity of the 
margin model may be warranted. In 
addition, investigation on the validity of 
the margin model is also performed by 
LCH SA Risk Management when: (i) 
backtesting shows that any individual 
market has numerous breaches and/or 
falls below the target confidence level 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00093 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES321 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 51
Portfolio backtesting results are notified at least 
quarterly to the Risk Committee where any breaches 
of target confidence level and mitigating actions are 
presented. A daily monitor is also distributed to 
CROs and Business Heads. 
52
The results of the model validation process are 
reported to ERCo with one of three grades: (i) 
satisfactory; (ii) needs improvement; or (iii) 
unsatisfactory. 
53
A Market is defined as a market undertaking, 
which is either a legal or operational entity 
providing a trade feed to a CCP or an OTC market 
where trading is arranged on a bilateral basis. 
54
A Product is defined as a series of Contracts 
that have similar characteristics or specifications. 
55
A Contract is defined to mean either a 
derivatives contract with a unique product 
specification or any individual security accepted on 
the cash or fixed income markets. 
56
References to potential CPSS–IOSCO and 
ESMA standards set out in the current policy have 
been removed as unnecessary. 
57
As an exception to this requirement, a new 
trade source or venue for an existing Clearing 
Service or Product may be approved by the LCH SA 
ERCo, provided that it has assured that there is no 
change to the risk profile of LCH SA and that a 
satisfactory operational risk assessment has been 
completed. 
and/or fails the adjusted significance 
tests; or (ii) margin shortfalls are 
identified for specific products or 
specific market conditions.
51
 
The outcomes of this investigation are 
reported to the LCH SA Head of Market 
Risk. Possible actions in response 
include: (i) taking member specific 
action such as the calling of additional 
margin; (ii) reviewing the margin rates 
for individual contracts/securities 
responsible for breaches; and (iii) 
conducting an intermediate review of 
the underlying methodologies and 
inputs to verify their suitability. 
Further, the MGVRP sets out the 
process by which models are 
independently validated. The model 
validation process evaluates the 
conceptual and practical soundness of 
models. The MGVRP sets out a detailed 
list of the steps that must be taken into 
account when conducting a 
comprehensive validation of each 
margin model, including a model that 
uses stress testing, the liquidity risk 
framework, collateral risk framework 
and credit scoring framework.
52
 
A comprehensive validation of margin 
models will include the following: 
€A review of all documentation/ information provided by the model 
developer; 
€An analysis of margin models, both core initial margin and margin add-ons 
including Default Fund Additional 
Margin; 
€An evaluation of the conceptual soundness of the model and framework 
structure; 
€A review of the on-going monitoring procedures such as daily 
margin coverage and back-testing; 
€A review of the parameters and assumptions made in the development 
of the models, their methodologies and 
the framework including an assessment 
of the theoretical and empirical 
properties of the model; 
€A review of the adequacy and appropriateness of the models, their 
methodologies and framework adopted 
in respect of the type of contracts they 
apply to; 
€An analysis of the outcomes of testing results against LCH performance 
criteria; 
€A review of the diversification benefits of the model where applicable; 
€A review of the margin period of risk where applicable; 
€An assessment of pro-cyclical effects and how such affects are 
mitigated where applicable; 
€A review of price data, pricing models, market data and the use of 
proxies; 
€An assessment of margin model sensitivity to the material risk factors 
and correlations (if applicable) through 
sensitivity analysis; 
€Assurance that the model complies with applicable LCH SA policies; and 
€Assurance that the model continues to meet regulatory requirements. 
In addition, a comprehensive 
validation of a model that uses stress 
testing will include the following: 
€A review of all documentation/ information provided by the model 
developer; 
€An analysis of the risks which are not covered by margin models, but 
included in stress testing; 
€An assessment of the stress testing framework and ensure LCH SA has 
defined extreme but plausible 
conditions; 
€An analysis of stress testing outcomes; 
€An assessment of the comprehensiveness of the stress testing 
framework, taking account of all 
relevant risk factors and products LCH 
SA clears; 
€An evaluation of the degree of consideration that the stress tests 
incorporate correlation, concentration 
risk and emerging risk captured by 
hypothetical/theoretical scenarios; 
€Assurance that the model complies with applicable LCH SA policies; and 
€Assurance that the model continues to meet regulatory requirements. 
Finally, the MGVRP provides that 
LCH will disclose the general principles 
of its underlying models, 
methodologies, nature of tests 
performed and a high-level summary of 
test results unless such disclosure may 
put at risk business secrecy and 
soundness of LCH. 
g. Contract and Market Acceptability 
Policy 
The Contract and Market 
Acceptability Policy (‘‘CMAP’’) 
describes the principles and factors that 
will be applied whenever any new 
Market,
53
Product
54
or Contract
55
is 
proposed to be accepted by LCH SA.
56
 
In particular, the CMAP sets out a 
standard approach to assessing the 
acceptability of new contracts and 
markets in order to assure that LCH SA: 
(i) understands all factors that may 
influence its decision whether to accept, 
and risk manage, a new Contract or 
Market (or maturity); (ii) identifies, 
manages and monitors any new risks 
that may be posed by the introduction 
of the new Contract or Market; (iii) 
highlights the need for any additional 
risk measures, such as amendments to 
the existing initial margin calculations; 
(iv) ensures an ongoing consistent 
approach to the assessment of new 
Contracts; and (v) informs the market 
place and maintains and demonstrates a 
level playing field. 
The CMAP sets out the process by 
which different Markets, Products and 
Contracts are approved and accepted for 
clearing. Specifically: 
€Any new class of OTC derivatives must be reviewed and approved if any 
by the relevant regulators subject to the 
appropriate internal governance 
process. 
€Any new Market is subject to review by LCH SA’s Risk Committee 
and approval by the Board.
57
 
€Any new Product or Contract that exhibits novel risk features or requires 
significant changes to existing risk 
controls must be approved by LCH SA’s 
Risk Committee and the Board. 
€The LCH SA ERCo has the delegated authority of LCH SA’s Risk 
Committee/Board to approve any new 
Contracts, Products or trade sources 
which present no novel risks and 
require minimal changes to existing risk 
controls. Where the ERCo has approved 
such Contracts, Products or trade 
source, the Risk Committee will be 
notified at their next meeting. 
€LCH SA’s Operations Department has been delegated authority from ERCo 
to approve more conventional Products 
and Contracts that arise from the normal 
day to day course of business and that 
meet the criteria set out in the Appendix 
to the CMAP, and may also approve 
new Contracts that LCH SA has 
contractually agreed to clear within a 
pre-determined framework and 
VerDate Sep<11>2014  16:30 Jan 02, 2026 Jkt 268001 PO 00000 Frm 00094 Fmt 4703 Sfmt 4703 E:\FR\FM\05JAN1.SGM 05JAN1
khammond on DSK9W7S144PROD with NOTICES322 Federal Register/ Vol. 91, No. 2 / Monday, January 5, 2026 / Notices 58
The LCH SA ERCo must approve the 
procedures. 
59
The types of Products and Contracts covered by 
the Appendix are: New Cash Equity (DVP/RVP) 
Products; New Cash Bond (DVP/RVP) Products 
(excluding Repo/FI Services); New Cash European 
Structured (DVP/RVP) Products (Warrants); New 
CDS Contracts; New Exchange Traded Futures and 
Options Contracts; Fixed Income Repurchase/Buy 
Sell Bank Securities; and New Digital Assets Traded 
Futures and Options Contracts. 
60
As also referred to in the MGVRP. 
61
A minimum of three creditworthy clearing 
members are required for any new Market, although 
a greater number is preferred. 
62
In order to establish a reliable mark-to-market 
price, any new Product or Contract must have 
prices that are updated daily from a reliable 
source(s). In this regard, LCH SA may rely on a 
recognized exchange as the sole source of prices for 
exchange-traded products, but OTC traded Products 
or Contracts must have at least three reliable 
sources of bids. Further, price validation controls 
such as price variance and staleness tolerances 
must be in place to ensure on-going quality 
assurance of all price data. 
63
Expected volume, open interest, issuance and 
bid/offer costs should be evaluated for each new 
Product or Contract to ensure there is sufficient 
liquidity to close positions in the event of a member 
default. Where a new Contract is added to a group 
of similar Contracts that fall into an existing 
liquidity margin class, the liquidity assessment will 
be that of the existing liquidity margin class. 
64
Each service is required to have in place a 
contingency arrangement for receiving trades and 
must test at least annually the daily trading volume 
capacity (for primary and contingency 
arrangements) and total outstanding trades, or 
where relevant outstanding positions, capacity. The 
results of the capacity testing and minimum system 
capacity requirements are to be reported by each 
service to LCH SA ERCo at least annually. LCH SA 
ERCo reserves the right to set a higher multiplier 
for a given service to reflect the potential exposure 
to a stress event or allowance for a growing service 
with limited history.

contractually related procedures.
58
The 
Appendix sets out in detail the 
acceptance criteria for various 
characteristics of new Products and 
Contracts. The characteristics are 
determined by the type of Product or 
Contract
59
and include, for instance, the 
markets such products are traded on, 
the country of domicile, the ICSD, and 
the issuer rating. In such cases, the 
ERCo will be notified each quarter with 
the volume and type of the Contracts 
and Products approved by the delegate. 
The CMAP also clarifies the roles and 
responsibilities within LCH SA for 
compliance with the CMAP. In this 
regard: (i) LCH SA ERCo is responsible 
for reviewing and making decisions on 
the suitability of new Contract and 
Market requests for clearing; (ii) the 
relevant clearing service is responsible 
for preparing and evaluating requests 
with respect to the minimum 
requirements and principles described 
in the CMAP prior to presentation to 
LCH SA ERCo and for reviewing price 
validation controls on a regular basis 
with LCH SA Risk responsible for 
approving any changes; and (iii) LCH 
SA’s Operations Department, when 
acting in the capacity of approval 
delegate, is responsible to ensure new 
requests meet the minimum 
requirements described in the CMAP. 
LCH SA’s Operations Department is also 
responsible for notifying LCH SA ERCo 
quarterly of the new contracts approved 
each quarter. 
The CMAP reaffirms the principles 
underlying the policy, emphasizing that 
all Products accepted for clearing must 
be eligible to be cleared according to the 
regulations applicable in each 
jurisdiction in which LCH SA operates. 
Further, in determining the 
acceptability of a new Contract, Product 
or Market, LCH SA must ensure that (i) 
in the event of a default, if the defaulted 
member had positions in that Contract, 
Product or Market, that LCH SA could 
manage the close-out of those positions 
within the scope of the LCH Default 
Management Policy; and (ii) there is 
sufficient price discovery to determine a 
reliable market value of the Product or 
Contract. The CMAP further provides 
that another important principle to be 
followed when accepting a new 
Contract, Product or Market is to ensure 
that the risk measures and principles in 
the applicable margining methodology 
are in line with its specific risks. LCH 
SA’s standard margining policies or 
methodology may therefore be 
amended, subject to the relevant 
internal governance process
60
and 
regulatory approval, to appropriately 
risk manage a new Contract or Market. 
The CMAP sets out the factors that 
LCH SA will consider in assessing any 
new Market, Product or Contract, 
including: (i) membership or 
counterparty risk;
61
(ii) standardization 
of Products; (iii) pricing;
62
(iv) product 
liquidity;
63
(v) default management; (vi) 
market risk; (vii) operational risk and 
associated Internal Capital Adequacy 
Assessment Process (ICAAP) risks;
64
 
(viii) legal, compliance, insurance and 
reputational risk; (ix) settlement risk; (x) 
liquidity risk; (xi) issuer risk; and (xii) 
foreign currency risk. 
Finally, the CMAP (i) provides that all 
Markets and Products will be reviewed 
on an ongoing basis to assure that they 
continue to comply with the criteria set 
out in the policy including that after 
such a review, an annual summary and 
statement must be presented to the Risk 
Committee and (ii) describes the 
procedures by which changes to the 
policy and its annexes may be 
approved. 
2. Statutory Basis 
LCH SA has determined that Risk 
Policies are consistent with the 
requirements of Section 17A of the 
Act
65
and regulations thereunder 
applicable to it, including Commission 
Rule 17ad–22(e).
66
In particular, Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires, inter 
alia, that the rules of a clearing agency ‘‘promote the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of . . . 
derivatives agreements, contracts, and 
transactions’’ and ‘‘assure the 
safeguarding of securities and funds that 
are in its custody or control or for which 
it is responsible.’’
67
These elements of 
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act are 
addressed by: (i) the CRP, which 
establishes standards for the selection 
and monitoring of intermediaries that 
LCH SA uses for settlement, payment 
and custody services; and (ii) the IRP, 
which sets out the principles, standards, 
and monitoring practices governing LCH 
SA’s management of investment risk. 
The CRP sets out more clearly LCH 
SA’s standards for the management of 
risks that may arise from the 
intermediaries used for settlement, 
payment and custody activities in order 
to mitigate better the risks arising from 
the default or operational failure of one 
or more intermediaries. Among other 
standards, the policy sets a preference 
for central banks over other 
intermediaries and ICSD/CSD over 
credit institutions, thereby prioritizing 
entities with the highest levels of safety 
and reliability for LCH SA’s custody and 
control of securities and funds. By 
requiring the use of operationally robust 
intermediaries, the CRP reduces the risk 
of settlement or payment failures and, 
therefore, promotes the prompt and 
accurate clearance and settlement of 
derivatives agreements, contracts, and 
transactions, consistent with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F). The policy requires 
intermediaries to meet internal credit 
scores and describes the steps that will 
be taken if an intermediary no longer 
meets such thresholds, including risk- 
mitigation plans and potential 
termination of the intermediary 
relationship, to ensure continued 
safeguarding of securities and funds. 
The CRP also mandates due diligence to 
confirm that assets belonging to LCH SA 
or its clearing members are fully 
segregated, identifiable, and promptly 
accessible in the event of a default, 
ensuring that client securities and funds 
are safeguarded and can be recovered 
without delay. To limit settlement risk, 
the policy requires ‘‘delivery versus 
payment’’ settlement where applicable 
and controls for any ‘‘free of payment 
settlements’’, as well as payment finality

from concentration banks. The CRP 
therefore also meets the requirements of 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act by assuring the 
safeguarding of securities and funds that 
are in LCH SA’s custody or control or 
for which it is responsible. 
In addition, the policy establishes 
robust controls to validate all payment 
amounts and recipients, requires 
independent annual testing of such 
controls, and sets out procedures for 
regular monitoring and escalation of any 
breaches or settlement failures. Manual 
payments require dual validation and 
oversight by senior management, 
reducing the risk of misappropriation or 
operational error and therefore 
promoting the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of derivatives 
agreements, contracts, and transactions. 
The policy also sets out the procedures 
by which LCH SA monitors the risks to 
which it and its clearing members may 
be exposed from such intermediaries. 
Separately, the IRP enhances the 
standards for managing the risk arising 
from the investment of cash funds 
derived from: (i) margins; (ii) default 
fund contributions; (iii) CCP capital and 
retained earnings; and (iv) cash arising 
from settlement failures. The policy 
restricts counterparty and eligible 
issuers to sovereign governments, 
central banks, government guaranteed 
institutions, certain supranational 
entities, and credit and financial 
institutions, each of which must meet 
the internal credit scores or other 
standards set out in the policy. 
Permissible investments under the IRP 
are restricted to cash, securities, 
derivatives, foreign exchange products 
and repurchase and reverse repurchase 
transactions. The policy also establishes 
a formal approval process of new 
investment products with executive and 
board oversight. These measures 
minimize credit, market and liquidity 
risk, and help ensure the prompt and 
reliable access to assets, thereby 
promoting the prompt and accurate 
clearance and settlement of derivatives 
agreements, contracts and transactions 
as required under Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 
of the Act. 
The policy also sets robust investment 
risk limits, including a weighted average 
portfolio maturity cap of two years; 
daily interest-rate-risk stress testing 
with potential losses capped at 10% of 
capital resources; and secured versus 
unsecured and counterparty 
concentration. In setting such limits, 
LCH SA assures the safeguarding of 
securities and funds that are in LCH 
SA’s custody or control or for which it 
is responsible, in line with Section 
17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 
Collectively, the foregoing policies 
and procedures set out in the CRP and 
the IRP are designed to ensure the 
‘‘prompt and accurate clearance and 
settlement of . . . derivatives 
agreements, contracts, and transactions’’ 
and the ‘‘safeguarding of securities and 
funds which are in the custody or 
control of the clearing agency’’. As such, 
these policies are consistent with those 
parts of Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(2)(i) 
provides that each covered clearing 
agency must establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
provide for governance arrangements 
that are clear and transparent.

As 
discussed above, each of the Risk 
Policies expands on and clarifies the 
standards by which LCH SA manages 
the various risks to which it is exposed 
as a CCP. Importantly, each Risk Policy 
clearly describes the roles and 
responsibilities of the various units 
within LCH SA or LCH Group, as 
applicable, responsible for compliance 
with each policy. For example, the DMP 
specifies that LCH SA Risk is 
responsible for: (i) maintaining LCH 
SA’s Default Management Guidelines; 
(ii) designing and organizing company- 
wide default management fire drill tests 
on at least an annual basis; and (iii) the 
ongoing monitoring of compliance with 
the DMP. In addition, LCH SA Legal is 
responsible: (i) in conjunction with each 
Clearing Service and the Rule Change 
Committee and LCH SA Compliance, for 
ensuring that key aspects of default 
procedures are publicly disclosed in the 
Rulebook or other disclosures; (ii) in 
conjunction with Compliance, for 
notifying the relevant regulators in the 
event of a default; and (iii) in 
conjunction with LCH SA’s External 
Communications, for drafting and 
delivering the default notice. 
Governance standards have also been 
strengthened, more fully describing the 
responsibility of the CEO to place a 
clearing member in default and initiate 
a Default Crisis Management Team and 
Default Management Group to manage 
the default. 
Similarly, the LRP clearly explains 
that: (i) LCH SA CaLM is responsible for 
maintaining a liquidity plan, conducting 
liquidity tests and managing the day-to- 
day liquidity of LCH SA according to 
the standards set out in the LRP, and for 
notifying LCH SA ERCo immediately of 
any exceptions; (ii) LCH SA CaLM Risk 
monitors and measures the adequacy of 
the cash levels held to meet the 
outflows, and reports issues for 
potential corrective action to LCH SA 
CaLM; and (iii) LCH SA Operations is 
responsible for the operational and 
control processes related to intraday 
liquidity flows and interoperability 
arrangements. 
By expanding on and clarifying the 
standards by which LCH SA manages 
the various risks to which it is exposed 
as a CCP and more clearly describing 
the roles and responsibilities of the 
various units within LCH SA or LCH 
Group, as applicable, responsible for 
compliance with each Risk Policy, the 
Risk Policies provide for governance 
arrangements that are clear and 
transparent. As such, the Risk Policies 
are consistent with Commission Rule 
17ad–22(e)(2)(i).
69
 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(2)(v)
70
 
provides that each covered clearing 
agency must establish, implement, 
maintain, and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
specify clear and direct lines of 
responsibility. As discussed in detail 
immediately above, each Risk Policy 
clearly describes the roles and 
responsibilities of the various units 
within LCH SA or LCH Group, as 
applicable, responsible for compliance 
with each policy. By more clearly 
describing the roles and responsibilities 
of the various units within LCH SA or 
LCH Group, as applicable, responsible 
for compliance with each Risk Policy, 
the Risk Policies specify clear and direct 
lines of responsibility. As such, the Risk 
Policies are consistent with Commission 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(2)(v).
71
 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(7)
72
 
requires each covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to effectively 
measure, monitor, and manage the 
liquidity risk that arises in or is borne 
by the covered clearing agency, 
including measuring, monitoring, and 
managing its settlement and funding 
flows on an ongoing and timely basis, 
and its use of intraday liquidity by, inter 
alia, (i) maintaining sufficient liquid resources at the minimum in all relevant 
currencies to effect same-day and, 
where appropriate, intraday and 
multiday settlement of payment 
obligations with a high degree of 
confidence under a wide range of 
foreseeable stress scenarios that 
includes, but is not limited to, the 
default of the participant family that 
would generate the largest aggregate 
payment obligation for the covered 
clearing agency in extreme but plausible

agency has payment obligations owed to

(iii) using the

the board of directors of the covered 
clearing agency, to enhance its 
management of liquidity risk;

and (iv) 
determining the amount and regularly 
testing the sufficiency of the liquid 
resources held for the purpose of

under Commission Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(7)(i), by meeting, at a minimum, 
the items listed in Commission Rule 
17ad–22(e)(7)(vi)(A) to (D).
77
 
As noted, the LRP sets out the 
standards pursuant to which LCH SA 
ensures that it has enough cash on hand 
to meet all expected and unexpected 
financial obligations throughout the 
day. The LRP identifies both the 
primary liquidity resources available to 
LCH SA and the primary sources of 
liquidity requirements. The policy 
requires LCH SA to assess its liquidity 
position: (i) daily at an aggregated level 
and on all material currencies; (ii) over 
a forward liquidity period of 30 days; 
and (iii) intraday at various times when 
the CCP has scheduled obligations to 
pay.
78
 
The assessment must also factor in 
regulatory restrictions on the use and 
liquidation of client assets maintained 
in segregated accounts and consider 
stress scenarios that include restricted 
market access and behavioral 
assumptions on how members may 
withdraw cash during times of stress. 
Importantly, the LRP provides that the 
liquidity assessment must: (i) model the 
gross liquidity impact of the default of 
the two member groups with the largest 
liquidity requirement; (ii) include 
‘‘extreme but plausible’’ stress 
scenarios; and (iii) include reverse stress 
testing that models extreme but 
plausible market scenarios in order to 
help determine the limits of the current 
model, including the plausibility 
thresholds which would trigger more in- 
depth analysis. Finally, the policy 
requires that the model used to conduct 
liquidity stress testing must be reviewed 
through reverse stress testing on at least 
a monthly basis, with any findings 
reported to LCH SA’s CRO, ERCo and 
the Risk Committee, and validated 
annually by an independent Model 
Validation Team, with any findings 
reported to ERCo and the Risk 
Committee.
79
 
By requiring LCH SA to assess its 
liquidity position at least daily to 
assure, inter alia, that it has sufficient liquid resources in all relevant 
currencies to meet its financial 
requirements in extreme but plausible 
stress scenarios, the LRP is consistent 
with the requirements of Commission 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(7).
80
 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(13) 
requires a covered clearing agency to 
ensure that it has the authority and 
operational capacity to take timely 
action to contain losses and liquidity 
demands and continue to meet its 
obligations by, at a minimum, requiring 
the covered clearing agency’s 
participants and, when practicable, 
other stakeholders to participate in the 
testing and review of its default 
procedures, including any close-out 
procedures, at least annually and 
following material changes thereto.
81
In 
addition to strengthening the default 
governance and clarifying the roles and 
responsibilities of the units within LCH 
SA for managing a default of a clearing 
member, the DMP sets out the standards 
that each Default Management Group 
must meet, requires each Clearing 
Service to have a defined exit 
methodology for a defaulted clearing 
member’s portfolio, including 
procedures that describe: (i) the hedging 
and execution methodology for 
neutralizing material directional risks of 
the defaulting portfolio, where 
applicable; (ii) where an auction 
(transferring the risk of a defaulted 
clearing member to other members) is 
relied upon as part of its closeout 
procedure, the intended auction process 
to be followed (including the auction 
type, participation requirements, 
acceptance of bid(s), portfolio 
allocation, transfer and 
collateralization); and (iii) the 
portability arrangements necessary to 
facilitate the porting and liquidation of 
a clearing member’s clients’ positions 
and collateral. The DMP also requires 
that the default management reports 
maintained by each Clearing Service 
must distinguish the segregated assets 
and liabilities for each member and 
client account at both intra-day and end 
of day intervals. Finally, each Clearing 
Service must conduct regular fire drill 
tests including testing extreme but 
plausible scenarios and participate in 
the annual joint fire drill exercises 
across both CCPs. 
By requiring LCH SA to have a 
defined exit methodology for a 
defaulted clearing member’s portfolio, 
to maintain default management reports 
that distinguish the segregated assets 
and liabilities for each member and 
client account at both intra-day and end 
of day intervals, and to conduct regular 
fire drill tests including testing extreme 
but plausible scenarios and to 
participate in the annual joint fire drill 
exercises, the DMP is consistent with 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(13).
82
 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(16) 
requires a covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to safeguard the 
clearing agency’s own and its 
participants’ assets, minimize the risk of 
loss and delay in access to these assets, 
and invest such assets in instruments 
with minimal credit, market, and 
liquidity risks.
83
The IRP sets out the 
standards for the management of LCH 
SA’s investment risk. In addition to 
clarifying the roles and responsibilities 
within LCH SA for compliance with the 
policy, noted above, the IRP: (i) restricts 
counterparties and eligible issuers to 
sovereign governments, central banks, 
government guaranteed institutions, 
certain supranational entities, and credit 
and financial institutions, each of which 
must meet the internal credit scores or 
other standards set out in the IRP; (ii) 
sets investment criteria with regard to 
cash, securities, derivatives, foreign 
exchange products and repurchase and 
reverse repurchase transactions
84
as 
well as requirements with regard to the 
approval of new investment products; 
and (iii) sets investment risk limits. The 
policy also clarifies responsibility for 
approving a new investment 
counterparty or issuer, as well as the 
process by which counterparties, issuers 
and concentration limits are approved 
and modified.

requires a covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain and

reasonably designed to effectively 
identify, measure, monitor, and manage 
its credit exposures to participants and 
those arising from its payment, clearing, 
and settlement processes by, inter alia, 
performing a model validation for its 
credit risk models not less than 
annually or more frequently as may be

In addition, 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(6)(vii) 
requires a covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain and

reasonably designed to cover, if the 
covered clearing agency provides 
central counterparty services, its credit 
exposures to its participants by 
establishing a risk-based margin system 
that requires a model validation for the 
covered clearing agency’s margin system 
and related models to be performed not 
less than annually, or more frequently 
as may be contemplated by the covered 
clearing agency’s risk management 
framework

established pursuant to 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(3).

or is borne by the covered clearing 
agency, including measuring,

The MGVRP applies to: (i) a margin 
model that estimates market risk under 
certain conditions or assumptions; (ii) a 
stress testing framework used for default 
fund sizing; (iii) a model providing a 
valuation for a financial product subject 
to a CCP guarantee or received as 
collateral; (iv) a credit scoring model 
providing an assessment of the 
creditworthiness of a CCP’s 
counterparties, provided the model has 
the features identified in the policy; (v) 
the liquidity risk framework managing 
the risk that LCH Group and its entities 
do not have sufficient liquidity to meet 
their payment obligations as they fall 
due under certain market conditions; 
(vi) the collateral risk framework 
defining the haircut methodology 
applicable to eligible collateral posted 
by members; and (vii) the model 
performance framework inclusive of 
statistical back-testing. The MGVRP 
describes standards by which LCH SA 
will monitor the performance of models, 
identifying, in particular, the standards 
pursuant to which each CCP will 
conduct daily backtesting of portfolios 
and margin models. 
The MGVRP requires that each model 
must be independently validated at least 
once every 12 months by the LCH SA 
Model Validation team or an external 
party to confirm that the model is still 
performing adequately and sets out the 
process by which models are 
independently validated. The MGVRP 
provides that model validation process 
must evaluate the conceptual and 
practical soundness of models and sets 
out a detailed list of the steps that will 
be taken in conducting a comprehensive 
validation of each of the margin models, 
i.e., a model that uses stress testing, the liquidity risk framework, collateral risk 
framework and credit scoring 
framework. 
By setting standards by which LCH 
SA will monitor the performance of 
models, identifying in particular, the 
standards pursuant to which each CCP 
will conduct daily backtesting of 
portfolios and margin models and 
requiring that each model must be 
independently validated at least every 
12 months by the LCH SA Model 
Validation team or an external party to 
confirm that the model is still

Governance, Validation and Review 
Policy is consistent with Commission 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(4)(vii),
92
Commission 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(6)(vii)
93
and 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(7)(vii).
94
 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(5) 
requires a covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to limit the assets 
it accepts as collateral to those with low 
credit, liquidity, and market risks, and 
set and enforce appropriately 
conservative haircuts and concentration 
limits if the covered clearing agency 
requires collateral to manage its or its 
participants’ credit exposures.
95
 
By setting (i) the principles and 
criteria applied when determining 
whether an asset may be accepted by 
LCH SA as collateral for margin cover, 
and (ii) conservative counterparty 
concentration limits, haircut matrices 
and add-ons, and other applicable 
limits, the IRP is consistent with 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(5). 
In addition, Commission Rule 17ad– 
22(e)(6)(iii) requires covered clearing 
agency to establish, implement, 
maintain and enforce written policies 
and procedures reasonably designed to 
cover, if the covered clearing agency 
provides central counterparty services, 
its credit exposures to its participants by 
establishing a risk-based margin system 
that, at a minimum, calculates margin 
sufficient to cover its potential future 
exposure to participants in the interval 
between the last margin collection and 
the close out of positions following a 
participant default.
96
 
The MGVRP sets out the relevant 
steps relating to (i) a new or changed 
model from initiation to validation and 
(ii) regular independent model 
validation and backtesting of all models. 
As noted above, the MGVRP applies to 
a change or review of, or a new: (i) 
margin model that estimates market risk 
under certain conditions or 
assumptions; (ii) stress testing 
framework used for default fund sizing; 
(iii) model providing a valuation for a 
financial product subject to a CCP 
guarantee or received as collateral; (iv) 
credit scoring model providing an 
assessment of the creditworthiness of a 
CCP’s counterparties; (v) liquidity risk 
framework managing the risk that LCH 
Group and its entities do not have 
sufficient liquidity to meet their 
payment obligations as they fall due 
under certain market conditions; (vi) 
collateral risk framework defining the 
haircut methodology applicable to 
eligible collateral posted by clearing 
members; and (vii) model performance 
framework inclusive of statistical back- 
testing.

backtested to ensure coverage of 
potential future exposure, the MGVRP 
allows LCH SA to evaluate the riskiness 
of an intermediary and make 
appropriate risk-based financial 
assumptions on margin adequacy which 
is consistent with Commission Rule 
17ad–22(e)(5) and 17ad–22(e)(6)(iii). 
Finally, in order to remove any 
potential surprise element in the market 
in the event LCH SA is required to make 
one or more clearing member 
assessments, each default fund must 
publish the potential member 
assessments that would be called if a set 
number of the top clearing members 
were to default. 
Commission Rule 17ad–22(e)(3)(i) 
requires a covered clearing agency to 
establish, implement, maintain and 
enforce written policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to maintain a 
sound risk management framework for 
comprehensively managing legal, credit, 
liquidity, operational, general business, 
investment, custody, and other risks 
that arise in or are borne by the covered 
clearing agency, which includes risk 
management policies, procedures, and 
systems designed to identify, measure, 
monitor, and manage the range of risks 
that arise in or are borne by the covered 
clearing agency, that are subject to 
review on a specified periodic basis and 
approved by the board of directors 
annually.
97
As discussed above, the 
CMAP describes the principles and 
factors that will be applied whenever 
any new Market, Product or Contract is 
proposed to be accepted by LCH SA. In 
particular, potential new Contracts and 
Markets will be assessed in order to 
assure that LCH SA: (i) understands all 
factors that may influence its decision 
whether to accept, and risk manage, a 
new Contract or Market (or maturity); 
(ii) identifies, manages and monitors 
any new risks that may be posed by the 
introduction of the new Contract or 
Market; (iii) highlights the need for any 
additional risk measures, such as 
amendments to the existing initial 
margin calculations; (iv) ensures an 
ongoing consistent approach to the 
assessment of new Contracts; and (v) 
informs the market place and maintains 
and demonstrates a level playing field. 
The factors that LCH SA will consider 
in assessing any new Market, Product or 
Contract, include: (i) membership or 
counterparty risk; (ii) standardization of 
Products; (iii) pricing; (iv) product 
liquidity; (v) default management; (vi) 
market risk; (vii) operational risk and 
associated ICAAP risks; (viii) legal, 
compliance, insurance and reputational 
risk; (ix) settlement risk; (x) liquidity 
risk; (xi) issuer risk; and (xii) foreign 
currency risk. 
By setting out the principles and 
factors that will be applied whenever 
any new Market, Product or Contract is 
proposed to be accepted by LCH SA, the 
CMAP is consistent with Commission 
Rule 17ad–22(e)(3)(i).
98
This is because 
the CMAP comprehensively sets out a 
number of risk related factors that 
should be considered when LCH SA 
considers new Markets, Products or 
Contracts, allowing LCH SA to evaluate 
and ultimately manage any such related 
risks. 
B. Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Burden on Competition 
Section 17A(b)(3)(I) of the Act 
requires that the rules of a clearing 
agency not impose any burden on 
competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the 
purposes of the Act.
99
LCH SA does not 
believe the Risk Policies would have 
any impact, or impose any burden, on 
competition. The Risk Policies do not 
address any competitive issue or have 
any significant impact on the 
competition among central 
counterparties. LCH SA operates an 
open access clearing model, and the 
Risk Policies will have no direct effect 
on this open access model, subject to 
LCH SA’s regulatory requirements and 
clearing rules, provisions and overall 
governance process, including the 
clearing membership eligibility criteria 
and appropriate credit risk assessment. 
C. Clearing Agency’s Statement on 
Comments on the Proposed Rule 
Change Received From Members, 
Participants or Others 
Written comments relating to the Risk 
Policies have not been solicited or 
received. LCH SA will notify the 
Commission of any written comments 
received by LCH SA. 
III. Date of Effectiveness of the 
Proposed Rule Change 
Within 45 days of the date of 
publication of this notice in the Federal 
Register or within such longer period up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may 
designate if it finds such longer period 
to be appropriate and publishes its 
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which 
the self-regulatory organization 
consents, the Commission will: (A) by 
order approve or disapprove such 
proposed rule change, or (B) institute 
proceedings to determine whether the 
proposed rule change should be 
disapproved.P 
IV. Solicitation of Comments 
Interested persons are invited to 
submit written data, views and 
arguments concerning the foregoing,

[Docket No. EP 730 (Sub-No. 1)] 
Roster of Arbitrators—Annual Update 
Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 11708, the 
Board’s regulations establish a voluntary 
and binding arbitration process to 
resolve rail rate and practice complaints 
that are subject to the Board’s 
jurisdiction. Section 11708(f) provides 
that, unless parties otherwise agree, an 
arbitrator or panel of arbitrators shall be 
selected from a roster maintained by the 
Board. Accordingly, the Board’s rules 
establish a process for creating and 
maintaining a roster of arbitrators. 49 
CFR 1108.6(b). 
The Board most recently updated its 
roster of arbitrators by decision served 
March 5, 2025. The roster is published 
on the Board’s website at www.stb.gov 
(click the ‘‘Resources’’ tab, select 
‘‘Litigation Alternatives’’ from the 
dropdown menu, click on the 
‘‘Arbitration’’ link, and click on the 
‘‘Roster of Arbitrators’’ link). 
As provided under 49 CFR 1108.6(b), 
the Board updates the roster of 
arbitrators annually. Accordingly, the 
Board is now requesting the names and 
qualifications of new arbitrators who 
wish to be placed on the roster. Current 
arbitrators who wish to remain on the 
roster must notify the Board of their 
continued availability and confirm that 
the biographical information on file 
with the Board remains accurate and, if 
not, provide any necessary updates. 
Arbitrators who do not confirm their 
continued availability will be removed 
from the roster. This decision will be 
served on all current arbitrators. 
Any person who wishes to be added 
to the roster should file an application 
that describes the applicant’s experience 
with rail transportation and economic 
regulation, as well as professional or 
business experience, including 
agriculture, in the private sector. The 
submission should also describe the 
applicant’s training in dispute 
resolution and/or experience in 
arbitration or other forms of dispute 
resolution, including the number of 
years of experience. Lastly, the 
submission should provide the 
applicant’s contact information and 
information on fees. 
All comments—including filings from 
new applicants, updates to existing 
arbitrator information, and 
confirmations of continued 
availability—should be submitted either 
via e-filing on the Board’s website or in 
writing addressed to 395 E Street SW, 
Washington, DC 20423–0001 by January 
29, 2026. The Board will assess each 
new applicant’s qualifications to 
determine which individuals can ably 
serve as arbitrators based on the criteria 
established under 49 CFR 1108.6(b). The 
Board will then establish an updated 
roster of arbitrators. The roster will 
include a brief biographical sketch of 
each arbitrator, including information 
such as background, area(s) of expertise, 
arbitration experience, and geographical 
location, as well as contact information 
and fees. The roster will be published 
on the Board’s website. 
It is ordered: 
1. Applications from persons 
interested in being added to the Board’s 
roster of arbitrators, and confirmations 
of continued availability (with updates, 
if any, to existing arbitrator information) 
from persons currently on the 
arbitration roster, are due by January 29, 
2026. 
2. This decision will be served on all 
current arbitrators and published in the 
Federal Register. 
3. This decision is effective on the 
date of service. 
Decided: December 30, 2025.

Counsel, Office of Chief Counsel.
